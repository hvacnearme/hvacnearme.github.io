<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, considering that the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

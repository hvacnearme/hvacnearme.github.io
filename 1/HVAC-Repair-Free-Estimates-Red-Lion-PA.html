<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators.

If you currently have a house heating system, you might try to find a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters.

While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>

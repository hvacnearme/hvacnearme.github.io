<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

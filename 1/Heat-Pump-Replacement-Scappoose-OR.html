Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves examining the suggested connections in addition to temperature level and pressure assesses.

By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can typically be performed in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

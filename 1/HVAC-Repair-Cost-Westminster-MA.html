<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be warmed in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found simply a few feet listed below ground. In the summer season, the process reverses, therefore cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature remains constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer consistent and reputable heating and cooling.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as an automobile radiator or common home air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

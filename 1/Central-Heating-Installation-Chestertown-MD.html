<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>

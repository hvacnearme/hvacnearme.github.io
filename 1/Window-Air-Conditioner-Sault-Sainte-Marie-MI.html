<h3>Choosing the Ideal Sault Sainte Marie MI Business For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

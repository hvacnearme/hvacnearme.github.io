<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your automobile. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heater, you may search for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>

Olson Energy Service can deal with every aspect of your air conditioning maintenance, from checking everything inside your home including the thermostat to your outside systems.

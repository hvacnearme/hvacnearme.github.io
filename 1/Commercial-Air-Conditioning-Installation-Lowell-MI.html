Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>

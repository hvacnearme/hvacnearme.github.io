<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>

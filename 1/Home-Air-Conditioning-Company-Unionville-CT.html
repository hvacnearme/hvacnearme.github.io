<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>

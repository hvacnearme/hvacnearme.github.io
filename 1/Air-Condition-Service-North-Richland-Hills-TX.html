<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime.

<p>The very first a/c and fridges used poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

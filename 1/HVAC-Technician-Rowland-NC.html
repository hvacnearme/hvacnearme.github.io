<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature. Furnaces that kick on often may be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep.

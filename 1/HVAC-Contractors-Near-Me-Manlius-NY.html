<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

<p>A third method to choose whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your house may not have enough ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To discover odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>

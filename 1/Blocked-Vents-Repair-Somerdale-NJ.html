<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%.

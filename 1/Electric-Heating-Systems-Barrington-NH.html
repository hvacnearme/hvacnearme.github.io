<h3>Home Furnace in Barrington NH 03825</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>

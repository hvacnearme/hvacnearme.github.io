A building walk-through to check for odors and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings may be practical. Leaks need to be eliminated.

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>

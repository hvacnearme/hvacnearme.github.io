<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the kind of electricity.

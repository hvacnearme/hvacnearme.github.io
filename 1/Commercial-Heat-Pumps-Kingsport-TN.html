<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

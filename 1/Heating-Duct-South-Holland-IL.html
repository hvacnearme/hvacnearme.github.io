Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually enjoyed the single-family house installation company completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living.

Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

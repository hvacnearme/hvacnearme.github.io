<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning system and heat pump need to be free of all obstructions and debris. Clogs can obstruct the flow of condensed water and trigger moisture build-up within the system. Excess wetness can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, irregular temperature policy, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess wetness flows far from the system.<p>

Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure products, smoking, family products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating systems.

This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room cooling provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

Required air heating systems also tend to produce hot and cold spots throughout the house, due to the nature of how warm air rises to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 on average.

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

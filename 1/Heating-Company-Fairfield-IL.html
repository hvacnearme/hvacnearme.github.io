Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>

Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new building and construction (houses usually utilize between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>

<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path.

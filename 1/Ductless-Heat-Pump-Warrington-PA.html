Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right before a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my friends.<p>

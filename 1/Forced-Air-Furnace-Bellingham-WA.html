<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical functions of environmentally friendly homes as part of the growing green structure movement.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire housing market.<p>

A basic air conditioning unit transfers heat energy out of the space because its condenser coil launches heat outside.

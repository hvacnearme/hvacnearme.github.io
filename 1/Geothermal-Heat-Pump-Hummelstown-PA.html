<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>New a/c typically vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score implies higher energy efficiency and possibly lower energy costs. A good SEER ranking for you depends on your house size, where you live and other elements. Even the minimally permitted SEER rating is going to be a lot more energy effective than your present, old air conditioner. It's not always about picking the model with the highest SEER rating, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>The heatpump gained appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can extract heat from numerous sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air within. At first, heatpump HVAC systems were just utilized in moderate environments, however with improvements in low temperature operation and minimized loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>

<p>Stability Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and changed two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new furnaces can heat your house. Truthfully, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>

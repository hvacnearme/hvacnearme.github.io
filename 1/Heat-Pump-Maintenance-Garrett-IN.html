When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in Buena Park</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.

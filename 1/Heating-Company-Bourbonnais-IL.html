<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>

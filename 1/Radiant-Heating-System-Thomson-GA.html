<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other work environments is necessary not just for workers' convenience but likewise for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been connected to signs like headaches, tiredness, problem concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

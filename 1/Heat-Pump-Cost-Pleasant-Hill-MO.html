<p>A geothermal heat pump is also a really safe heating and cooling option, because it does not need any kind of combustion, unlike alternatives. This makes the WaterFurnace geothermal system a better choice for those who are concerned about safety, both in terms of individuals and the environment, with geothermal services offering an environmentally friendly energy source for heating and cooling houses.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>

Germs or micro-organisms might likewise exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire office or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>

<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources might not present a significant health danger by themselves, most houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a major risk from the cumulative effects of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that most people can take both to lower the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to take actions that can decrease the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

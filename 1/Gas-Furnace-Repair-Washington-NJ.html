<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

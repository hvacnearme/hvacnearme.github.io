<p>Initially, in terms of benefits, heating the whole home or structure from one system makes things much easier logistically, and the isolation of the heating unit from the home is a reward for some house owners.

Furthermore, residents can change temperature levels in various parts of the home by closing vents in ductwork or by using room or area-specific temperature level controls.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

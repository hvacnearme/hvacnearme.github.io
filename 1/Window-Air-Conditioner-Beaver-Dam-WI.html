<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized.

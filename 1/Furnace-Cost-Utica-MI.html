<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Heating Systems in Utica MI 48317</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each space in your home, and if it develops fractures which leak, they need to be repaired. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with worse results. Your home will not be adequately cooled, and your energy bills will increase. Setting up brand-new ductwork for the whole home will cost approximately between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this enter the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling several rooms simultaneously, but are not extremely energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>

A working a/c system is crucial to your health and convenience. We're offered at all hours to ensure that your system remains that way.<p>
<p>Before you head out and purchase an air conditioning system, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioner be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and reduce its life. Too little and your ac system will not be able to cool your house correctly. These are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into account when purchasing a new AC system. Each choice can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't pay for to disregard any of them.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>

Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

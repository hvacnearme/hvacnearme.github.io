<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Half Moon Bay CA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

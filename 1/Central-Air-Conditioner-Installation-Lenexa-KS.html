<h3>The Way to Eradicate Boiler Problems in Lenexa KS</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run constantly is since something is unclean or stopped up Before attempting to repair any issue, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, check the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, contact a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler typically occur.

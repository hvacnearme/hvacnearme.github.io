<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Company in Lewistown</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can generally be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Lewistown PA</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run constantly is because something is blocked or unclean Before attempting to fix any issue, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is good to go, examine the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. Get in touch with a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>

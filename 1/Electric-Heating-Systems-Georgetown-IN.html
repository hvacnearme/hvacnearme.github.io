<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>There are numerous actions a homeowner can require to select items that will avoid indoor air problems from happening - a couple of them are discussed here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, think about utilizing strong wood items. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes damp.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in Cortlandt Manor NY 10567</h3>
<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not present a significant health risk by themselves, the majority of homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a major risk from the cumulative results of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that most people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to prevent new problems from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can decrease the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>

In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this area.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might pick to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit.

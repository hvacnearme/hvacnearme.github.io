<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

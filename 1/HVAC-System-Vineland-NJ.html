<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Vineland NJ</h3>

After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

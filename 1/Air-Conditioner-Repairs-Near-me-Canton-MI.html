<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can stay and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these diseases do not show up until many years after direct exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothes and equipment brought house from job websites.<p>

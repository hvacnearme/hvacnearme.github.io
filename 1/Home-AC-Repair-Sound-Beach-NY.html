<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Sound Beach New York</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

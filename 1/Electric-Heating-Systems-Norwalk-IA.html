<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, as well as all other types of heat pumps, have efficiencies rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a clinical way of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. The majority of geothermal heatpump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This indicates for every single unit of energy used to power the system, 3 to five systems are provided as heat.<p>

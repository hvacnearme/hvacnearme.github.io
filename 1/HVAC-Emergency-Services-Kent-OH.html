<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>

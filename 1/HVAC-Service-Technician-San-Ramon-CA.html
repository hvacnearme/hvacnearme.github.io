<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, defective or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes examining the recommended connections as well as temperature level and pressure gauges. Take time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and secure.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Essentially, SEER offers more data based upon how the EER performs in various temps. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor.

<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction.

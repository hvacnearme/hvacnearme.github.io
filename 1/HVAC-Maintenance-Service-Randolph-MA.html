This can be done through central heating Such a system consists of a heat, boiler, or furnace  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a furnace room in a house, or a mechanical space in a large structure.

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may select to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, considering current modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be wiser to change the entire system.<p>

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

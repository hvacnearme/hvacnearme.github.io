<p>We're spending a lot more time indoors, these days. While many people assume pollution is just an outside problem, your house (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't believe sufficient about exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- immediately, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

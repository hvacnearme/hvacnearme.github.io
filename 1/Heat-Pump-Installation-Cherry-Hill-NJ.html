<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>

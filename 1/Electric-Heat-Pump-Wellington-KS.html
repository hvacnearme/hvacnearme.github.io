<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to install, specifically in an older house. Depending on the kind of system set up, it can be noisy and trigger issues if you're extremely adverse dust. In addition, specific fuels and equipment might need unique permits, and there is restricted flexibility in case of changed heating requirements.

<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health results mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the impacts kept in mind take place at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the home.

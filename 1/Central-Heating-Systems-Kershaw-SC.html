<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>

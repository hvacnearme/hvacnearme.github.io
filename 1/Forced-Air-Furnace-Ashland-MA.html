<p>Whatever heater you install, it's important that it's sized properly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too small, then your home will not be heated up effectively and the system will need to constantly run to attempt to heat the whole house, which will increase heating bills.<p>
<p>Since they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>

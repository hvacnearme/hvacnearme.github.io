<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

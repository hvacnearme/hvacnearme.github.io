Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Nevada MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

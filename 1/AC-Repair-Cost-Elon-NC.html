<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

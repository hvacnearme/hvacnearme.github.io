The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>. Before picking the installation area of air conditioner, several main aspects require to be thought about. First of all, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units must not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Secondly, there ought to not be any obstacles on the way of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible. The outside unit should also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently released outdoors and the productivity of the whole system will drop greatly.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

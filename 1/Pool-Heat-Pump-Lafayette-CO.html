<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>

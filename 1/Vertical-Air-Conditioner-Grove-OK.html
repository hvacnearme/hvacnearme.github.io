<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>

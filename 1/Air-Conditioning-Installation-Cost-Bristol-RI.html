<h3>Methods to Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Bristol RI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We picked getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

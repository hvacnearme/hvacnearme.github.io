<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., office devices; wall, floor and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>

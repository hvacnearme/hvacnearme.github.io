<p>Typically the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>

<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Saint Helens OR - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

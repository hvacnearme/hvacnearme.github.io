<p>Structures are created or planned to respond actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and preserve surfaces to enhance their longevity, performance, or look. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or perhaps considerably modify structures in ways that might be essential to their own stability or their effect on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We may find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, particularly, some of the methods used by scientists studying communities, in order to gain an improved understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>

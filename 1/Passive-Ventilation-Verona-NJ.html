Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week!

<p>If no pollutant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air may also be an issue when ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the variety of workers in the area.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Verona NJ?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

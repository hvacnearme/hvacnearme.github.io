<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on.

The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

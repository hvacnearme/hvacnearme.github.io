The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect.

<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Champlin MN</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

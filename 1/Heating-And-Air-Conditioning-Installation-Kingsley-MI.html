<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, missing or faulty wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes checking the advised connections as well as temperature and pressure gauges. Take time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and protected.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the same indoor air problems as single-family houses because much of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials, furnishings, and home products, are comparable. Indoor air problems similar to those in offices are triggered by such sources as infected ventilation systems, improperly put outdoor air consumptions, or maintenance activities.<p>

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working, integrity Energy was fast to react. They appeared the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new furnaces can heat the house. Honestly, our house heating unit is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>

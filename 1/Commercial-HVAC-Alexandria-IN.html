<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

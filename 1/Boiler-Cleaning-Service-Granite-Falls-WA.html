<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less regular (however often more major) cases of individuals ending up being ill after being in a particular structure at a specific time. In these cases, there is typically a similar set of scientific signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can typically be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by germs which can infect a building's cooling system.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators used flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

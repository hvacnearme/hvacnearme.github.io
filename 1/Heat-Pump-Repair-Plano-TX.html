<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

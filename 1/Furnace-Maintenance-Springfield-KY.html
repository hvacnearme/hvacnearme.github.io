<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Lots of AC units feature a number of special functions that can further improve performance and efficiency. For example, homeowners might wish to try to find one that features an integrated filter light that will notify you when the air filter requires to be changed. Another popular function to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to lower energy expenses a lot more. Naturally, more functions indicate higher central air conditioning expenses.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation.

<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden appear higher than normal, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>

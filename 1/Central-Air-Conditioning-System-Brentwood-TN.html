<h3>Facts All Brentwood TN Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>The majority of people understand that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can likewise have considerable, damaging result. EPA research studies of human exposure to air pollutants suggest that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the leading 5 ecological health risks to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

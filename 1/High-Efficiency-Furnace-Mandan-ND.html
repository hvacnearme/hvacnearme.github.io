Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>

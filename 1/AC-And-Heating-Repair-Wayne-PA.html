<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure residents might be exposed to a range of impurities (in the kind of particles and gases) from workplace devices, cleaning products, building and construction activities, home furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside contaminants. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Effingham SC</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler typically happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>

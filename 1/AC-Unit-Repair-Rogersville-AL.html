<h3>HVAC Service in Rogersville AL 35652</h3>

<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

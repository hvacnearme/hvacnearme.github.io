<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed.

Radon gas enters houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures build up inside.<p>

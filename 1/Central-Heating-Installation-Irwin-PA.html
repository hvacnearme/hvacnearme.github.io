<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet includes the evaporator. In lots of split-system air conditioning unit, this indoor cabinet also contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.

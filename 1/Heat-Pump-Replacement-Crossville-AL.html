The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

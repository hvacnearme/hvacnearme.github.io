Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

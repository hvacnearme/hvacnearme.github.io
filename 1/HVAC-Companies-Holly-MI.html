<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne.

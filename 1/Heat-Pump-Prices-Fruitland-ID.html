<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that someone as skilled as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the air conditioning unit before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>

<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>

<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Ferndale MI 48220</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

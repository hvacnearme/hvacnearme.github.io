We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>

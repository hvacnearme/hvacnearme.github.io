Central air conditioning conditioners need to be professionally inspected and changed before the start of every cooling season. However, don't let your maintenance end with this annual checkup. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak performance.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work properly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

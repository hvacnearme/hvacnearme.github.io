Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

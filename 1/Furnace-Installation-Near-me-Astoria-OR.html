<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in integrating a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges.

Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

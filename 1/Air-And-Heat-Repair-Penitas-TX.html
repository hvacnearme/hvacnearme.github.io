<p>All Points Heating provides home a/c, air conditioner installation, air conditioning unit maintenance that deliver reputable, tested performance at high efficiency. Combustion products from automobile exhaust, heaters, water heaters, space heating units, fragrant candle lights, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not appropriately vented can produce carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products may result in eye, nose, and throat irritation; tiredness; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it may simply need to be cleaned. Whether this is the cause of the problem, it's a great early treatment to try. Plan to do this on a fairly warm day. Never ever use a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins. The following are guidelines; always refer to your owner's handbook. Note: Constantly switch off the power before cleaning the system.<p>
<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Penitas Texas</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

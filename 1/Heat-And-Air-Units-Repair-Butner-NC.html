Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

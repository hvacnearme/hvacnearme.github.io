<p>The exhaust outlets enable all unsafe gases to leave your home so there's no risky accumulation of carbon monoxide and other such gases. They can lead to a hazardous build-up and compromise your security if the exhaust outlets are obstructed. The technician will evaluate all of these aspects of your system and check the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will search for indications of rust, leaks, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>

<p>Indoor air pollution is brought on by burning solid fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can differ considerably from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last.

In some cases, entirely new ductwork might need to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other kinds of heat pumps, have efficiencies ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a clinical way of determining how much energy the system moves versus how much it utilizes. A lot of geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every system of energy used to power the system, three to 5 systems are supplied as heat.<p>

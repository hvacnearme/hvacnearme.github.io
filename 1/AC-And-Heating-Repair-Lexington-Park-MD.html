<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>No matter the type of electric radiant flooring heating system, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or modified.

<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often may be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>

Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

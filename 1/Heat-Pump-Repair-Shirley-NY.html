<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

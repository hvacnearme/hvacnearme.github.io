<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..

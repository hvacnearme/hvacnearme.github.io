<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work effectively in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electricity, a heat pump is an affordable option using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

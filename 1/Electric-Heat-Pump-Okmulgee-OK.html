<p>Improve your services, make more services income, and provide an incredible client experience. To make sure the system you choose is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to figure out the specific kind of heat and air conditioning system that's ideal for your home-we do not just change it with the same size unit you currently have. These computations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is important so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated effectiveness benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>

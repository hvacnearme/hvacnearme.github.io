<p>. Prior to selecting the installation area of a/c unit, a number of main factors require to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there should not be any barriers on the way of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system needs to also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently discharged outdoors and the performance of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly recommended to set up the air conditioning system systems in quickly available places, for more maintenance throughout operation.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

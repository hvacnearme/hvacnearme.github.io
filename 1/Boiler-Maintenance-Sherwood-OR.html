<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>

Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

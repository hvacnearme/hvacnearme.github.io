<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to buy it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have actually satisfied in a very long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

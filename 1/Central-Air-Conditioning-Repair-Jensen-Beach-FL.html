<h3>What to Look for When Hiring an Jensen Beach FL HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter or summertime, having a working HVAC system is vital. At Lowe's, we have a variety of heating and cooling systems-- from heaters and heat pumps to window air conditioners and portable a/c unit Plus, we offer a/c installation and heating installation by certified professional independent installers. Not exactly sure if HVAC installation is in your budget? We're happy to use a range of unique funding choices. Our home services offerings make it easy to get what you need when you require it.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

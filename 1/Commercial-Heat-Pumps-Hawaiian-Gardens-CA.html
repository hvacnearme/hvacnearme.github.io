<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days.

<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems.

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

To make sure the unit you choose is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation price quote to determine the specific kind of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply replace it with the same size system you presently have.

Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

A standard air conditioning unit transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is eliminated.

<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>There are a number of variables that contribute to indoor air pollution. Such aspects consist of making use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide gas produced by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

<p>In some cases, however, building residents experience signs that do not fit the pattern of any specific health problem and are hard to trace to any particular phenomenon has been identified sick structure syndrome. Individuals might complain of several of the following symptoms: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; runny or stuffy nose; fatigue or lethargy; headache; lightheadedness; queasiness; irritation and forgetfulness. Poor lighting, noise, vibration, thermal discomfort, and mental stress might likewise cause, or contribute to, these symptoms.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "regular" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a certain standard.

<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>Air pollutants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks.

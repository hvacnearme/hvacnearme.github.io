<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Hazlet NJ</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

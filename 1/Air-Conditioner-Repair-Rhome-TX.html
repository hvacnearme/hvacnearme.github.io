<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power should not go beyond the capability of the outside unit.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

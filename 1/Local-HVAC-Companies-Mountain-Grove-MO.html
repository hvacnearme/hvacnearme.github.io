<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor.

<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

<p>Since they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

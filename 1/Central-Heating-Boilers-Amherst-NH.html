<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Amherst New Hampshire</h3>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

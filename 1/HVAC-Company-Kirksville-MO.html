<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

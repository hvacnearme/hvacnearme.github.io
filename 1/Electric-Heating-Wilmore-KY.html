<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Wilmore KY</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

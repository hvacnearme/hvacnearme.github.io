<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not impacted by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power depends on routine sunlight to work effectively.

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>

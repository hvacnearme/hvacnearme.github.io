<p>Evaluation your records from tracking your service calls, installation sales, service agreements and other sales, along with the profits and revenue for each category.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate.

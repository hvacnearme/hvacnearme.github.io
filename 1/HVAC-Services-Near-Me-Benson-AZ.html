<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

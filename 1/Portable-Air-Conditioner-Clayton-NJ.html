<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

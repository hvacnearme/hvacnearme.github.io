<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, as opposed to outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

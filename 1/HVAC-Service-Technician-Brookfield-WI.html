<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually.

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

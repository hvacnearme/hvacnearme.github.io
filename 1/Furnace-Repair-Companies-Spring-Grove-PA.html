<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

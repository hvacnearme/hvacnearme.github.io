<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house.

If your home is not heating up, just be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you must call in a professional to repair the system and examine.<p>

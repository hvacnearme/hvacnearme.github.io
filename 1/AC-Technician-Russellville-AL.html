Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for.

The likewise immediately followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>

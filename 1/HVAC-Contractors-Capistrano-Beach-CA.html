Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers.

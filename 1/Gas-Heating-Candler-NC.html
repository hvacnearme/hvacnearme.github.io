<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance.

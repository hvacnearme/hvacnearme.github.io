<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>

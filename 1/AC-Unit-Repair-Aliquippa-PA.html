<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>

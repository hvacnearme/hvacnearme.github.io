Annual furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace service warranty valid also.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

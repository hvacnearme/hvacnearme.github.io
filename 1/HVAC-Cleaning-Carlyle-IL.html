However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

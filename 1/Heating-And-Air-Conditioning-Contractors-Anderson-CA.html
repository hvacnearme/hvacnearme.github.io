<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>If you're feeling unpleasant about the costs associated with central AC installation, luckily, there are ways to save. First, look around to discover the best deals. Comparing quotes amongst local cooling companies can help to cut expenses. Furthermore, asking for a quote throughout a non-peak season, the fall or winter season, can also help you save money. In many regions of the nation, cooling companies are able to charge more during spring and summertime due to high need.<p>

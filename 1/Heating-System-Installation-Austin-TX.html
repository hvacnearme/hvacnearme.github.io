<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

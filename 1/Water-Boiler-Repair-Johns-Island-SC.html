<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Johns Island</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of industrial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and fridges employed flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

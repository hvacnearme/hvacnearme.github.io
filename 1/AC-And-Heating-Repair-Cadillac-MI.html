<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.

<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an air conditioning system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required expert help and spoke with many suppliers. Lastly, after a strenuous choice process, the area company picked Dometic. We've had a great deal of firsts throughout the years, but this custom task provided unique difficulties for our engineers," stated a spokesperson for Dometic. After extensive trials in Arizona, where the system needed to keep researchers and their equipment cool and dry, our technology is now ready for extra-terrestrial responsibility.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can often be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this data may determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>

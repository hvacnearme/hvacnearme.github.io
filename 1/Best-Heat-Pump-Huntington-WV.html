We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>

<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is generally utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice in between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the exact same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system can create a great deal of water since they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water.

<p>Many people undervalue the degree of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is generally visualized as the black smoke produced from factories.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

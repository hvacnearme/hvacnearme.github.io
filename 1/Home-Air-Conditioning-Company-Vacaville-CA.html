<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Vacaville CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having solved the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He was friendly, uncomplicated and a completely enjoyable person to have around that whole time. His time and expertise to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather uncertain diagnostic.<p>

Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work fairly well. Carpets will directly insulate the floor from the space, decreasing performance, so if you want to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with thick padding.<p>

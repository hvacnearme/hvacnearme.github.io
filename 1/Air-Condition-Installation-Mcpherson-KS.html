<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants.

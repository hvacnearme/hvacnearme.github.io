<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>

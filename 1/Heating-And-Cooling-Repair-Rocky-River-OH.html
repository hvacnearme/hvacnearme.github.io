<p>Expert heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals advise following this standard guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the price of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Location the solar tank near the traditional hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is likely that it is supported by the pipes. Install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be changed.<p>

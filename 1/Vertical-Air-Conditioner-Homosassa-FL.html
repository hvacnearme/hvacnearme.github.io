<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

Stability isn't just their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>

Follow the producer's directions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit properly changed.

Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

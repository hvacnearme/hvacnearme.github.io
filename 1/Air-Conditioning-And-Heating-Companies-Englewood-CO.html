Check the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it if the air filter is good to go. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, contact a skilled technician.<p>
<p>I have actually ended up being fairly skilled at investigating items on line prior to purchasing them. However I don't find that there is a central location for browsing details about the "real" worth of house HVAC systems or perhaps I need to say a sincere assessment of these products.

<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are offered to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Service!

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is wintry. Also, if the air conditioning unit smells bad, there might be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing.

The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>

<h3>Locating Greatest HVAC Contractors in Cotati CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

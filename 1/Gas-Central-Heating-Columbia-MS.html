<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a referral later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

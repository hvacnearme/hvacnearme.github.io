<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality issues.

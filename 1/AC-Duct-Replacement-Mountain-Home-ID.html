<p>These principles-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- may already be changing. Though only 33 percent of Seattle real estate systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new housing systems have been built in the 4 years since or are presently under building.

<p>Particular types of HVAC units are a bit more pricey than wall systems, ceiling or cassette units are nicely concealed inside the ceiling in the classroom and are therefore more discreet and visually pleasing to take a look at. They provide powerful airflow and are significantly more powerful than standard wall units and can, therefore, reduce the number of units required and this can reduce installation and or replacement costs where numerous HVAC units are required. Ducted commercial-grade air conditioning systems are BETTER for the instructional environment. They are typically the most pricey alternative; however, they are also the most visually pleasing as the duct-work and internal units concealed with very little presence.<p>

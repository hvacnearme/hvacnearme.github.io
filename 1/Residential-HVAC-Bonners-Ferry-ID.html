Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

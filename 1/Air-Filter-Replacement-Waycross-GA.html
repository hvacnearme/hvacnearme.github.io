The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can vary substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job might require completely different actions and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being inspected.

Sometimes, entirely brand-new ductwork may need to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>

But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>

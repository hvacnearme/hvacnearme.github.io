<p>I was extremely happy in the start because things ran efficiently with no sound. Furthermore, I saw noticeable modifications in my electrical power expenses.

In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Reputable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. But then understood Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Burtonsville MD 20866</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

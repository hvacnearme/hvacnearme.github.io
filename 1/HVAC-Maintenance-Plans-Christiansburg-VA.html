<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, consider potential results of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window slightly.<p>

<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house building is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heatpump must be without all clogs and debris. Blockages can obstruct the flow of condensed water and trigger moisture build-up within the system. Excess moisture can cause issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, unequal temperature regulation, germs, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to guarantee all excess moisture flows far from the system.<p>

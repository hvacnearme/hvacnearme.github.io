<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow limitation will lower the system's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one element (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>

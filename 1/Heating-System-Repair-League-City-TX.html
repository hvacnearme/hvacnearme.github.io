<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

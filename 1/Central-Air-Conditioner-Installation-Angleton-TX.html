Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services should still be available for your house's systems.

Next, inspect other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, dust and particles, an economical repair that can help increase performance. Likewise, check the vents and ducts for blockage. Finally, ensure the thermostat is working and positioned effectively. Try moving it far from direct sunshine considering that this might impact temperature readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your home.

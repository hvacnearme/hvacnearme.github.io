<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Pelham AL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might notice moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.

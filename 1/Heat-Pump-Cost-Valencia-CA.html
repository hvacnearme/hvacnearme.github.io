Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Since an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

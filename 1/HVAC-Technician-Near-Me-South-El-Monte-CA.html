HVAC specialists recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

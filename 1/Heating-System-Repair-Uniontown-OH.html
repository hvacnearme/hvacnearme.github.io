<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

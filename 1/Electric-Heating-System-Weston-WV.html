Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

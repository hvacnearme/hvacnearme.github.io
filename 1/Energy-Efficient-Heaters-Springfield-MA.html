This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

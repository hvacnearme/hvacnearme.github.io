<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

The choice to repair or replace depends on you, and often it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely offers greater energy efficiency and comes with guarantee coverage.<p>

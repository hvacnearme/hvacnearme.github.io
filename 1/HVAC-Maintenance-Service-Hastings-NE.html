<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling.

Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.

ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%.

She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>

<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>

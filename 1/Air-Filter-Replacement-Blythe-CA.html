Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>

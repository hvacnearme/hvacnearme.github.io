<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>

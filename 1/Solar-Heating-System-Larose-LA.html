A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors remove pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Lancaster SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Numerous aspects affect IAQ. These factors include bad ventilation (lack of outdoors air), issues controlling temperature, low or high humidity, recent improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air entering the building. Often, particular contaminants like dust from building or remodelling, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas over time) might trigger poor IAQ.<p>

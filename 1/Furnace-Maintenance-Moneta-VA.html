<p>When you buy a brand-new heating & cooling system, you're purchasing your home, your household, and your business. You deserve to know who will appear, how they will look, and believe in the company you've hired.

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a house heater, you may try to find a heatpump more tailored toward cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

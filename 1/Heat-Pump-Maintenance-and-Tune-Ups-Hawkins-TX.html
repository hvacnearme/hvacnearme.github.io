<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the inspection on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new homeowner I have actually learned how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

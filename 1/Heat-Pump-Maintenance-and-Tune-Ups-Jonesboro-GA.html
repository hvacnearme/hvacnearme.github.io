<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

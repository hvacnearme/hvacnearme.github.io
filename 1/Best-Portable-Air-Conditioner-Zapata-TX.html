What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and repaired very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>

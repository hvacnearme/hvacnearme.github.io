<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in shops to save money on costs (particularly during the night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the shops change beyond an acceptable variety that might prevent clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat.

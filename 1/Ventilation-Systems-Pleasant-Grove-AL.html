<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>

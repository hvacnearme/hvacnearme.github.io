<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

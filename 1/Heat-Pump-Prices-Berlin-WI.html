<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Just be worried if your house is not heating up. However, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice.

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

<p>The primary health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>

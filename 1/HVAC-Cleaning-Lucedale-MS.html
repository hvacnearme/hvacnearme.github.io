<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and air conditioning company.

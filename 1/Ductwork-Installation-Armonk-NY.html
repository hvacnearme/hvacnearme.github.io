<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

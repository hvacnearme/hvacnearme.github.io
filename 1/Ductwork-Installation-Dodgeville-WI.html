<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

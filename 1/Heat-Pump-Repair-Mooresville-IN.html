<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, a lot of Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a vicious, cruel summertime.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>

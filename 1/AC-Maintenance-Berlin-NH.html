<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.

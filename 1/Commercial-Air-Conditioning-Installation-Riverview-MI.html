Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 must not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

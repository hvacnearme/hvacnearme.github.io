<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was type of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Inappropriate modification, often shown by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. If you purchase a new gas range or variety, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never use a gas range to heat your home. Constantly make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>

<p>I am a real estate investor, I require to replace 2 heating systems in a 8000square foot house. You can depend on us to get the job done right. We deal with our four standard principles: integrity in whatever we do, reliability and punctuality, treating everybody with self-respect and providing the very best product at a sensible cost, even using numerous specials from time to time. Don't permit your heater or furnace to break down when you require it the most. We can make it work as efficiently as possible.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help manage bacteria and natural smells. Most store-bought filters can not remove these tiniest of allergens and don't eliminate bacteria and gases.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down quickly. This is a very typical repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensor changed as preventative maintenance due to the fact that the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space.

Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

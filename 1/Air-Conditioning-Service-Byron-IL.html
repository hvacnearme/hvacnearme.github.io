<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>

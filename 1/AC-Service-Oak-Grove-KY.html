<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>

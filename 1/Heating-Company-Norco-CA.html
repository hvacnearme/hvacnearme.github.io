<p>A health questionnaire should be established and distributed to all worried employees. Such a tool should recognize the number of individuals affected; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the workplace; suggest when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of particular health symptoms or health problems; recognize all machines operated in the workplace; indicate the kind of outside air contamination; and identify prospective sources of task tension.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

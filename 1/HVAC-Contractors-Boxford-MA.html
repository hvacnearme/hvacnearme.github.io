<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>

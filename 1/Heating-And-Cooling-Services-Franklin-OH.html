<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

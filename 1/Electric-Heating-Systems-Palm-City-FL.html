Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>These men have been terrific. At a realtor, I often require contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a home might cost. Just recently I needed to get in touch with these people twice. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work.

Stability isn't simply their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak with you soon.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>

<p>There are numerous actions a property owner can require to select products that will avoid indoor air issues from happening - a couple of them are discussed here. First, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about using strong wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>

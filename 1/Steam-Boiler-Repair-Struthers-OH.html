<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Tecumseh OK 74873</h3>

<p>Oil furnaces are generally not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but the majority of do not attain an efficiency higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having beginning expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well due to the fact that a drain needs to be installed.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.

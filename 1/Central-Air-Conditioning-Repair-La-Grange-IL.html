<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those dimensions on hand when looking for an a/c unit to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to install the air conditioning unit: Don't position it in an egress window that acts as the only means of escape should a fire emerge.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation in Celina OH 45822</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>

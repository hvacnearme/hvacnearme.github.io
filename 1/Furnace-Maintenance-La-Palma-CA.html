<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home.

<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>

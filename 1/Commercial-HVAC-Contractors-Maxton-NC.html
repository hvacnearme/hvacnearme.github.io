<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay products. Since they just partially remove the radon decay products and do not decrease the amount of radon getting in the home, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a trustworthy means of lowering the health threat from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies additional details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air toxins.<p>

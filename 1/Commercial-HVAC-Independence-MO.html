<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and structure occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of gases and particles) from workplace makers, cleaning products, building and construction activities, carpets and home furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside contaminants. Other factors such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>

What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do.

Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>

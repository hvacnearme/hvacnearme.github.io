<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the home. Pollutants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below.

Infections and germs, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

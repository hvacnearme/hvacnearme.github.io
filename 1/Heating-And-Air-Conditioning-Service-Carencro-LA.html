<p>A split air conditioning system consists of 2 main parts - a compressor located outside and a within air outlet system. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split ac system depend on a set of pipelines to connect the outdoor to the within air unit which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split air conditioning system installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipelines that cycle through the system to create either heated or cold air.<p>

<p>New air conditioners typically range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER rating implies higher energy effectiveness and possibly lower energy bills. An excellent SEER rating for you depends upon your home size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally permitted SEER score is going to be far more energy effective than your existing, old air conditioner. It's not always about picking the design with the greatest SEER rating, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside is connected with a higher frequency of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>Before cooling or installing any new heating system in a house, it is essential to re examine and minimize the energy load of the home. A more energy effective house will not just minimize the cost of a brand-new system and utility expenses, but it will greatly enhance the convenience of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic improvements typically include adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest several certified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>

<p>Because an ac system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean up the condenser coil.

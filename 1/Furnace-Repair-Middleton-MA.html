<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.

In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

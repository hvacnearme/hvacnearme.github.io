<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>

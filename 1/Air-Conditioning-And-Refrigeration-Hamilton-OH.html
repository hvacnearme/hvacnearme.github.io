<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family home installation company entirely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

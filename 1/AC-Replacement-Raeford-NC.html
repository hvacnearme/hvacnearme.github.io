Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>For instance, contaminants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outside toxin, it might serve as a path to bring the contaminants inside.

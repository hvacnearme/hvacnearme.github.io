PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room cooling provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, smoking, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems.

<p>A geothermal heater is more trusted than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on regular sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and available source of energy.<p>

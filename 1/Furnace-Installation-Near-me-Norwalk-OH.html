<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season.

<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Norwalk Ohio</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

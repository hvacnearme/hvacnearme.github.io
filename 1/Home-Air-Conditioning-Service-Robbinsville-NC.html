<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can suggest significant cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

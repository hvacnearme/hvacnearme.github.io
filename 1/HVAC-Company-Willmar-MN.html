<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heater. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing.

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically greater than many heatpump choices, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the design you purchase. One of the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperature levels than other heating options. This indicates it can heat up your home to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>

<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

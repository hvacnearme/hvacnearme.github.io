<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every three months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

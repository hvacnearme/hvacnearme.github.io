With no moving parts, it's comfy and very quiet, and it doesn't stir up as much dust and allergens, as compared to forced-air systems.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

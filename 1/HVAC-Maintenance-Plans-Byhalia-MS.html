<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, smoking cigarettes, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters.

Plus, there's even an added cleaning convenience as keeping the rooms dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

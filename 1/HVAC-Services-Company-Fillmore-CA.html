They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My other half said that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good individuals I have fulfilled in a long time. If we want to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine people who are there for us.

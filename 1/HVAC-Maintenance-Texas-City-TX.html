<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down rapidly. This is a very typical repair.

<h3>Ventilation Systems in Salyersville Kentucky</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>

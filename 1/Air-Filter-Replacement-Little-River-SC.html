<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat.

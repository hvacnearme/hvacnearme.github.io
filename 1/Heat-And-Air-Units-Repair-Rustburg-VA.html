<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

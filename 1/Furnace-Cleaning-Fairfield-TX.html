<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may end up being clogged, decreasing air flow quality, volume, and distribution. They also may become locations for molds and germs to grow and be dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise need to be correctly maintained to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>

<p>There are lots of reasons why this can happen. The good news is that you can deal with many of these aspects by yourself without the need to require professional assistance. Start by opening the heat registers and then proceed to examining the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can also inspect the filter to make certain it is clear of dirt and examine the standing pilot burner to make sure it is lit.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

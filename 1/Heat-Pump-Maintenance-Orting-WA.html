<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you know it remains in your house.

The results of CO exposure can differ considerably from individual to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>

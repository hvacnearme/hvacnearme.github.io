<h3>Air Condition Installation in Oceanside CA 92057</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on rare occasions.<p>

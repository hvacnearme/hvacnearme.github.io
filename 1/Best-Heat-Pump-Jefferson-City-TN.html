<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

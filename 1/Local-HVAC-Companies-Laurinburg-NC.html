<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those dimensions on hand when shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Also, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning unit: Do not position it in an egress window that acts as the only ways of escape should a fire emerge.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might see unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues.

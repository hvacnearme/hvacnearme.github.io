<h3>Boiler Heating System in Atmore AL 36502</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they identified the issue and fixed really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Quite a bit of research goes into changing or repairing a gas furnace such as selecting the ideal equipment and choosing the right contractor for the task. Being comprehensive and doing your homework will increase the possibilities of a smooth furnace installation or repair. Use our informative HVAC contractor list during your HVAC installation to make things easier on you and your furnace repair person.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out repairing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

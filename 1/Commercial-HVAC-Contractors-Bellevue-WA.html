<h2>How To Hire HVAC Services in Bellevue</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, many of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in structures and concentrations build up indoors, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

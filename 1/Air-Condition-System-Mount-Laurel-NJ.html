<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

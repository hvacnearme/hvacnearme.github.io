<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is truthful, reputable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Utilize professionals and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated experts perform much better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. An ethical company doesn't make use of cheap labor chances even if they're inexpensive. Affordable workmanship is normally shoddy workmanship, and it never assists a company construct long-lasting relationships with clients.<p>

<p>Sean was really practical. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

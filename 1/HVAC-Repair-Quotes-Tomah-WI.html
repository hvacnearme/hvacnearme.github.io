<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, workplaces and schools matters, particularly considering that we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives generally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with conventional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>

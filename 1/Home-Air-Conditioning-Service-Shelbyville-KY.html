<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

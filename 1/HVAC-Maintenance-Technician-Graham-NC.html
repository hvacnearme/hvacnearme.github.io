After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

A voided warranty will not do you any great must the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the outset and hire a certified person with the experience to install the system.<p>

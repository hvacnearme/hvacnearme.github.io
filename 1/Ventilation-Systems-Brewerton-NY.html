<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It may also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>

Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heater) with the very same amount of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>

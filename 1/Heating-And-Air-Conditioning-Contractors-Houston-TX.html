<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

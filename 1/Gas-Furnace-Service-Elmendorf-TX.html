<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new home owner I have actually discovered how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heater, you may search for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>

Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has watched the single-family home installation organisation entirely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

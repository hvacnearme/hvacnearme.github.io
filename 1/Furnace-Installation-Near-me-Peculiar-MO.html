<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, until the required for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under a number of owners. Goodrich's father was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to purchase what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally. By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

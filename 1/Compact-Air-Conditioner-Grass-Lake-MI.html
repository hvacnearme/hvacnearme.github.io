<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

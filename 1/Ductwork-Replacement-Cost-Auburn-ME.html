<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

<p>Speaking of air, radiant heating systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because required air heating systems distribute air-borne contaminants throughout the house during operation, provoking a range of different negative effects. Radiant heating systems don't distribute air at all, which really enhances your indoor air quality by limiting your exposure to high levels of air-borne impurities.<p>
<p>Particular kinds of HVAC systems are a little more expensive than wall units, ceiling or cassette units are nicely hidden inside the ceiling in the classroom and are therefore more discreet and visually pleasing to look at. They provide effective airflow and are considerably more powerful than basic wall units and can, for that reason, lower the number of units needed and this can reduce installation and or replacement costs where several HVAC systems are needed. Ducted commercial-grade cooling systems are BETTER for the educational environment. They are usually the most pricey choice; however, they are also the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal systems hidden with very little exposure.<p>

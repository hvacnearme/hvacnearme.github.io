<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. Since they only partly remove the radon decay items and do not diminish the amount of radon entering the house, the efficiency of these devices is uncertain. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reputable ways of lowering the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further information on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year.

Exposure to previously owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

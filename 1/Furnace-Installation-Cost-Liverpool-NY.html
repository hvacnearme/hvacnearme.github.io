<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation in Biddeford Maine</h3>
<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>You could upgrade to the highest effectiveness equipment offered and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The typical home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead.

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Turn off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work properly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

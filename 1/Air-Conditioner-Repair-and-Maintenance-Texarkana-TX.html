<p>A customized air conditioner that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air course. A standard air conditioning unit transfers heat out of the space because its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

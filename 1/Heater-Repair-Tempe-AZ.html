After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance.

In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

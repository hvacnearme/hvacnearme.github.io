<p>A customized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

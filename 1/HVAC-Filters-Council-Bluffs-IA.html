<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to buy it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have satisfied in a long period of time.

Load calculating is described as the Handbook J calculation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your house also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>As you generally need to apply a self-leveling substance on top of the electric underfloor heater, you need to factor in the time it takes for this to completely dry prior to the flooring covering can be put in place - this is normally a day or two.

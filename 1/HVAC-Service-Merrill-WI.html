<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

Also, tidy ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system occasionally.<p>

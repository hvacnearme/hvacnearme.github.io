<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

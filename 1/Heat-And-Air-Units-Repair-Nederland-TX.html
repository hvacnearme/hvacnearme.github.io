<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

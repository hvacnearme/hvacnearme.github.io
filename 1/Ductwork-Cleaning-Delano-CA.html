<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more affordable technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Your furnace is a financial investment; if dealt with right, it could heat your home for many years without issues.

He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been finished, the last job is to check the system to make certain it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

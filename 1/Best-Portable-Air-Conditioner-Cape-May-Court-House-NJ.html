<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple process.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Broadview IL</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from a company or seller to do the installation. If you choose to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed individual to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the a/c system. A voided guarantee will not do you any good must the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the start and employ a licensed person with the experience to set up the system.<p>

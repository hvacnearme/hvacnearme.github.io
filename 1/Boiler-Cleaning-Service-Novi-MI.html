<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

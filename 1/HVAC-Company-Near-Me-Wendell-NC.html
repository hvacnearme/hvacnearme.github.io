<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions must also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners must be alert to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps need to not be undertaken until these issues have actually been remedied.<p>

Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

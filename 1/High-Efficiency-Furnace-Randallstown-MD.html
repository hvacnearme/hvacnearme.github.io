<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

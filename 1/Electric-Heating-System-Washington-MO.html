<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

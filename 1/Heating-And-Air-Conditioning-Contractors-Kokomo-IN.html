<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

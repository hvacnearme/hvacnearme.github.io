Among the primary locations where blockages begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood items used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is usually recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops ought to be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate items of incomplete combustion.

The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>

You will also enjoy a much more flexible system in terms of installation and cost.

<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

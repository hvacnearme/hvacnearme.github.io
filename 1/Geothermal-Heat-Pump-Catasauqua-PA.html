<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

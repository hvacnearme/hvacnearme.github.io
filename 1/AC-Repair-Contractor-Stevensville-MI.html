<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Stevensville Michigan</h3>
<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi annual maintenance today.

He demonstrated the points of inspection and also recommended I have a UV light installed due to a little buildup of mold collecting in the air handler, which he thoroughly cleaned up the exterior and examined compressor coils along with ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also removed the leaves that collected inside the interior of the compressor unit and recommended an option to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I received a detailed email report of the examination detailing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I extremely suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

An expert maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess moisture flows far from the system.<p>

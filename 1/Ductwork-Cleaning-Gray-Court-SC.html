EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of signs in numerous countless asthmatic children, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain.

Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

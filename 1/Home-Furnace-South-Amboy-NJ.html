The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We picked getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

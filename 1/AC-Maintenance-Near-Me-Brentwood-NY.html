<p>Nick B. provided exceptional, personalized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction style is friendly, effective and appealing. He clearly and thoroughly explained all issues and fixes in a way that made me confident in his capability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a required part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my wife and I would not need to endure another night without heat, during one of the coldest winter seasons in recent memory. He also reacted to my call instantly the next early morning, and coached me through a momentary fix to a problem that could not be fixed on the first see due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of recurring use of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a very useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>

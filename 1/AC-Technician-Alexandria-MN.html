In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing.

No extra charge.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>

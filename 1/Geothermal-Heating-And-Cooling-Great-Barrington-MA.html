<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else limiting the flow of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers impact your comfort, they can also cause duct leakages due to excessive atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT a great concept. You will not conserve any additional money and will end up causing more issues for your heating system.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>

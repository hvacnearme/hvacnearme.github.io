<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other work environments is very important not just for workers' convenience however likewise for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been connected to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, difficulty focusing, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types.

<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every 4 years. The Fundamentals Handbook consists of heating and cooling calculations.

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales male concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the options for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>

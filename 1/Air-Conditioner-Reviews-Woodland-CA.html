<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>When asbestos-containing material is damaged or disintegrates, microscopic fibers are dispersed into the air. Inhalation of asbestos fibers over long exposure times is related to increased incidence of lung cancer, in specific the specific form mesothelioma The danger of lung cancer from inhaling asbestos fibers is significantly higher to smokers, however there is no confirmed connection to damage brought on by asbestosis The symptoms of the disease do not usually appear till about 20 to 30 years after the very first exposure to asbestos.<p>

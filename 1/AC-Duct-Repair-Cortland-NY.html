<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near to your home as possible per my request.

Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

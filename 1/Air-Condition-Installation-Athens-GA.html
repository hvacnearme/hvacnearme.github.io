Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

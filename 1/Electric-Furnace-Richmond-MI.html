For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal convenience inside.

<p>In basic, ductless AC systems are more energy-efficient and eco-friendly than traditional A/cs. This is due to the fact that you can shut off individual rooms when you're not inhabiting them.

<p>The possibility of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential impacts. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends upon individual sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who explained our alternatives did an excellent task in ensuring we understood the pros and cons of each option. The service technicians who set up the new system were professional and quick, while requiring time to make certain we comprehended how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>

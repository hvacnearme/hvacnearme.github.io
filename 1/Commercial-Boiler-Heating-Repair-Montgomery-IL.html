<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. Basically, SEER provides more information based on how the EER performs in different temps. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

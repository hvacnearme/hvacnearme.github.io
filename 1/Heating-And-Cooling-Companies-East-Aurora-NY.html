<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>

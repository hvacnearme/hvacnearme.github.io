The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up.

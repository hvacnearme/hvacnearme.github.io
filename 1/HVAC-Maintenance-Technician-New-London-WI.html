<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

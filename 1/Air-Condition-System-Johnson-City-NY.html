<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide agreements.. The so called reliable companies rip off more people than the fly by night clothing.

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>

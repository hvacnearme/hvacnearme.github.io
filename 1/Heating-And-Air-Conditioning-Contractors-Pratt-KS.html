The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>

This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Jewett City Connecticut</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was type of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

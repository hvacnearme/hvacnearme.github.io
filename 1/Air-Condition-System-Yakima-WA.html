Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>

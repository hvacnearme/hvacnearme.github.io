<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Companies in Chicopee</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

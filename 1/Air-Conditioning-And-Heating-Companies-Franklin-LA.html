Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the service technicians believed they simply didn't appear best and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>

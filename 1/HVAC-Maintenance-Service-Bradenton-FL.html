<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by numerous people.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>

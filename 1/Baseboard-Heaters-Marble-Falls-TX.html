<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. , if it does not, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

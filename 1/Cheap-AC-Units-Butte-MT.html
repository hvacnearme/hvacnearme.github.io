<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>

Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Afton OK</h3>
<p>Aspects that can add to the growth of biological pollutants are wet or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and family plants.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been completed, the last task is to test the system to ensure it cools successfully. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat.

<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A basic a/c unit transfers heat out of the room since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

<h3>How To Choose An HVAC Company at Montgomery NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

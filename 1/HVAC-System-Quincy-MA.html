<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if required, update the structure envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

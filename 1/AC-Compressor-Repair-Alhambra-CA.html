To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

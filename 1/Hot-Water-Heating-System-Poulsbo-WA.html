<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>

The typical summertime temperature level to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to reach the proper SEER ranking for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all brand-new air conditioning systems made in the United States.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a range of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has recognized structure materials, home furnishings, and mold as severe issues, but much of the threat also originates from burning things.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job.

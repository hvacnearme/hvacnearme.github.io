The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel.

You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

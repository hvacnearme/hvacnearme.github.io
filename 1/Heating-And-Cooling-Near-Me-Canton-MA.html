Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

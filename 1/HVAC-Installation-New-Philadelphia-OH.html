The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to buy it. My spouse stated that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good people I have satisfied in a very long time.

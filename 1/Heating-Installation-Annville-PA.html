<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your company needs to check measurements of temperature level, humidity and air flow. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for developing use and tenancy) should be carried out. A structure walk-through to check for smells and look for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings may be useful. Leakages need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become contaminated with fungi or germs and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some scenarios, particular screening for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos requires to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are less common now than gas, but they can be useful in more remote areas where utilities are more difficult to gain access to, and in cooler environments because it offers more heat per BTU than other solutions. The installation cost will be lower, but energy expenses will be greater, as much as three times higher than gas or electric furnaces. They need a tank on the instant residential or commercial property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. Overall, they supply an AFUE ranking of in between 80 and 90 percent.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While room a/c provides maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

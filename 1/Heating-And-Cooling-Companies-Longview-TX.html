<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

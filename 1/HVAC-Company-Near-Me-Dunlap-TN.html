<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>

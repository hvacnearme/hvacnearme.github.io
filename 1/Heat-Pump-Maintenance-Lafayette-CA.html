<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Lafayette CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

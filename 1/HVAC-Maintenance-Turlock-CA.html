<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered terrific customer service at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

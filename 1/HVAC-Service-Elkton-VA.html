But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden seem greater than typical, it is probably time to think about a new system.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

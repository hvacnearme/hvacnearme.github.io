<h3>How to Limit the Prices of Air Conditioner Repair at Flat Rock NC</h3>
<p>Many people are aware that outdoor air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can also have significant, damaging effect. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants suggest that indoor levels of contaminants may be two to 5 times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the top 5 environmental health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Because it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

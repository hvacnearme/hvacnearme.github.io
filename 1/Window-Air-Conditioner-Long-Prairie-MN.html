<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Long Prairie MN Home Owners</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. First, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are really educated and expert. Costs are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today. Because the cost was certainly sensible, I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

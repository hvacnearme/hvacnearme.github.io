<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is sincere, dependable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

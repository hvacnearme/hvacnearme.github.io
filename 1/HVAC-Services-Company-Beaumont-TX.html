<p>Companies are needed to follow the General Task Provision of the OSHAct, which requires them to supply employees with a safe work environment that does not have any recognized risks that cause or are likely to cause death or serious injury. The OSHAct also requires companies to obey occupational security and health requirements produced under it.

The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%.

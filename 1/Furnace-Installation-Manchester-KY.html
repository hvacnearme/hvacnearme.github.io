<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or merely a high level of competition for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical salaries for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk with your physician about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>

<p>Heat Exchanger Replacement: â $ " Â The heat exchanger is at the very core of the furnace.

<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>

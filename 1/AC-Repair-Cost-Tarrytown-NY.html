<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are offered to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Service! Climate Pro is trusted and genuinely cared about us and our circumstance. We came home one night to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that same night.

Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week!

<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heating system) with the exact same amount of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

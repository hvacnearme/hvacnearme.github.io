<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different methodologies. The CMHC research study gotten in touch with a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they became part of a study, and the researchers did not manage for time invested or methods used.

Due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>

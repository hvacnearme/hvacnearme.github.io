<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>

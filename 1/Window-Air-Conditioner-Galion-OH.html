<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years back and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>

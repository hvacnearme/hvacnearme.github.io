<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of delays in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, children, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults considering that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Allergic Your Central Heating Boiler in Saint Ann MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

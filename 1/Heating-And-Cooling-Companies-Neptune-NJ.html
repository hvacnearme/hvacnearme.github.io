I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Am pleased I got this however because it has restored my faith in great manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Provider I got because I purchased it 7 months ago.

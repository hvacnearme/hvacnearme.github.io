<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality problems. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic duty provision" uses. This stipulation, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, mentions that a company must provide a safe and healthy  workplace. Hence, ensuring the air is of great quality is the company's task.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

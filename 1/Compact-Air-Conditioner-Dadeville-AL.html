<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your automobile. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter as soon as every three months. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Floral Park NY Home Owners</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate because it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

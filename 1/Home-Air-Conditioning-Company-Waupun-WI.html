<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in Waupun WI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

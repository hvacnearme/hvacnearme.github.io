<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Lindsay CA</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes set up under the floor or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

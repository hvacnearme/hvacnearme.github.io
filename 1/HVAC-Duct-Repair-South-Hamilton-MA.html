<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally greater than lots of heat pump choices, they can still be highly effective, depending upon the model you purchase. One of the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating choices. This indicates it can heat up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>

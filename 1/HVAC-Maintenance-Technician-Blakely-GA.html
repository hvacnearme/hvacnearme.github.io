<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Blakely GA</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the flooring or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

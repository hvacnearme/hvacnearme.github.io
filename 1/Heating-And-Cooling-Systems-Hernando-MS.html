<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Hernando MS - The Benefits</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

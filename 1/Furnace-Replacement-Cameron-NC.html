<p>It's a reality that a new furnace for your house is one of the more substantial expenses involved in home ownership. But, it needs to also be seen as a long-term financial investment. All of the latest heating systems are far more energy-efficient than those installed even 20 years back.

<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher earnings for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or simply a high level of competition for competent trades.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>

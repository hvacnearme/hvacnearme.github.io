HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new.

Basically, SEER provides more data based on how the EER performs in various temps. The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>

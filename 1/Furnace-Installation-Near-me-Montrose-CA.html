<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Montrose CA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

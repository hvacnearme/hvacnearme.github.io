<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop air conditioners are performance-tested to get rid of uncommon or harsh roadway and weather conditions. Many standard systems break down after simply four hours of severe vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more!

<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>

Such details can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this data may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

Such immediate impacts are typically short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized.

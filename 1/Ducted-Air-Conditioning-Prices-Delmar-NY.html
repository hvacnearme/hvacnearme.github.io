<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>

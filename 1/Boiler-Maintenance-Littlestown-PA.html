<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve).

If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

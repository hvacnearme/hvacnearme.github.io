<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

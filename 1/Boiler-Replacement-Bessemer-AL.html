<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations develop indoors, direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

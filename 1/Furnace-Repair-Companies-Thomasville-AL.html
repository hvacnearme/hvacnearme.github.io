<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location.

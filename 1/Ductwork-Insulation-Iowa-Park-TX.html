<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant might bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Regardless of the kind of electric radiant floor heating unit, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or modified.

Nevertheless, assuming they are installed correctly and properly taken care of, the likelihood of them having issues is little.<p>

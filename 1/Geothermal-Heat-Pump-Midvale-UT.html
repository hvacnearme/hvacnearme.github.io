<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

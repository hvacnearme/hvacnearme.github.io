<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Also they diagnosed the problem and repaired extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t correctly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>

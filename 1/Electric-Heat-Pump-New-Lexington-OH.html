<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at New Lexington OH</h3>
<p>Our team is led by the 2 Gamst bros who both began working on a/c unit with their father John Gamst after school and on weekends. Whether it's servicing, furnace, repair, or air conditioning installation, neither one keeps in mind learning the trade it simply came naturally.

<p>The condensate drain in your a/c unit and heatpump must be free of all blockages and particles. Clogs can obstruct the flow of condensed water and trigger moisture accumulation within the system. Excess wetness can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, unequal temperature level regulation, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to guarantee all excess moisture flows far from the system.<p>

<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they diagnosed the problem and repaired extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã Most furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnÃ¢ $ t correctly detected, altering a board wonÃ¢ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. ItÃ¢ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>

These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect.

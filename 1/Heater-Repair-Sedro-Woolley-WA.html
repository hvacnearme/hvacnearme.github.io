<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

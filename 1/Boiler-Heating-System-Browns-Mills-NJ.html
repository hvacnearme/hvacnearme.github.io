But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden seem higher than normal, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system. New heating equipment is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel costs right away, not to point out the money you'll save on repair costs. If your heating system is 25 years of ages or more, you can probably anticipate to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

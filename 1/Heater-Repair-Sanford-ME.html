The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding.

<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home.

<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heater) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>The first thing that you will in fact have to install will be the air handler, which will be available in your central heating system installation kit.

When installing this part, ensure that the condenser drain is installed in such a way that it will have the ability to recede safely.<p>
<p>Individuals have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint because these activities produce large amounts of lead dust. Consult your state health or real estate department for suggestions on which private laboratories or public agencies may have the ability to help test your house for lead in paint. Home test sets can not identify small amounts of lead under some conditions. Work with a person with special training for remedying lead paint issues to eliminate lead-based paint. Residents, especially kids and pregnant women, need to leave the structure up until all work is completed and clean-up is done.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit can produce a lot of water because they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

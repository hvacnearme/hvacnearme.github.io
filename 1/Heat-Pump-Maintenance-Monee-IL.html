<h3>Furnace Repair in Monee Illinois</h3>
<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. Also, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there could be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach listed below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>

Your contractor picks each part of the system individually so that whatever operates at top performance to supply the comfort you need. All the system parts are matched-the furnace, the condensing unit, fans and blowers, a/c coil, the duct work-to produce a heating & cooling system that will work best for you.<p>

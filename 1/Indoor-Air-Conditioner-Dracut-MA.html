<p>It is likewise suggested for citizens of Redmond to have access to heater inside their houses. Throughout the winter seasons, furnaces supply sufficient heating power to homes in the neighborhood. The average daytime temperature highs throughout December, January, and February range from the mid-40s to low-50s.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

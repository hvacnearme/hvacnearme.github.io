This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>

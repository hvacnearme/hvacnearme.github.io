<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors.

<h3>Electric Heating System in Pampa TX 79065</h3>
<p>Consumer products that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive eliminators, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can cause signs associated with exposure to carbon monoxide. Carefully check out the labels including health risk info and cautions on the proper usage of these products. When possible; use indoors just if the area is well ventilated, usage products that consist of methylene chloride outdoors.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might discover undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your physician about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative must ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this data might determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of toxin exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at home over the weekend. Place control involves moving the contaminant source away from residents or even moving vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure distinctions created by these forces move airborne toxins from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move till the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Direct exposure Assessment Methodology (GROUP) research studies discovered levels of about a dozen common natural contaminants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside houses than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or extremely commercial areas. Extra GROUP studies suggest that while individuals are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to really high toxin levels, and raised concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>

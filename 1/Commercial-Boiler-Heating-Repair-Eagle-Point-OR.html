<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Eagle Point OR</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>

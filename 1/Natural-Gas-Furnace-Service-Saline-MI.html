<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

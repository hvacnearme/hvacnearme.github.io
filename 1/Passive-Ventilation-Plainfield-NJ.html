<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them..

<p>My eldest son constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those procedures include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>

<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

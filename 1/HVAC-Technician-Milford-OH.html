<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

As an outcome your oil or gas furnace may run longer to provide the very same quantity of heat. This will cause your energy bills to go up. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies monthly could be used to assist you pay for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace.

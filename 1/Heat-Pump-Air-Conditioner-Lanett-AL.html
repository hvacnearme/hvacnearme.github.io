<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the outcome of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air blood circulation. Workplace temperatures need to be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air blood circulation ought to be prevented.<p>

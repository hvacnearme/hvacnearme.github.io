I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern.

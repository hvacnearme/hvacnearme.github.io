First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about utilizing solid wood items. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>

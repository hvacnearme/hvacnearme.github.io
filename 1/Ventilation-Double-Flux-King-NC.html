<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

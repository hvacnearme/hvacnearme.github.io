<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

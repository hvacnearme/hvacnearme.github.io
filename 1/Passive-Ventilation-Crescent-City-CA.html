<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and dirty. The old coolant will adversely impact the system's efficiency. To make sure the system is working efficiently, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>

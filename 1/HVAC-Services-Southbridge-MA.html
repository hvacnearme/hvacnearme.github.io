<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a range of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has identified building products, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, however much of the danger also originates from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building occupants might be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the type of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning items, building and construction activities, furnishings and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

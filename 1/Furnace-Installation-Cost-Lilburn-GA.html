<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..

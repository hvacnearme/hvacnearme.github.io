Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>. Prior to picking the installation location of air conditioner, a number of main factors require to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the location of rest or workspace.

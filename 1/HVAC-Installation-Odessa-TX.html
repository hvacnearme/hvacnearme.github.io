<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>

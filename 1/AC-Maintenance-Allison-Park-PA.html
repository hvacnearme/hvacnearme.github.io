<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues.

Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>

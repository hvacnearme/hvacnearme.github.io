Breathing air contaminants can lead to asthmatic and allergic responses, infections and other illness that involve the lungs, nose and throat.

Previously owned smoke is also hazardous to people, specifically kids.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

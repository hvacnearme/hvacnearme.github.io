<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors.

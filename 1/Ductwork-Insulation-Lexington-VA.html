<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Lexington VA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home building and construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofing systems. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Heating, air, and ventilation conditioning (HVAC) systems need routine maintenance and care. These are the systems that keep your home comfortable all year long. Regular maintenance plays a crucial function in making sure that your cooling and heating system remains running efficiently which you get the most out of your investment.

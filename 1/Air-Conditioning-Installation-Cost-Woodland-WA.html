<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<h3>AC Compressor in Woodland WA 98674</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

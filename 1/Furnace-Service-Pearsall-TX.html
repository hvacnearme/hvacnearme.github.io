<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material with time.

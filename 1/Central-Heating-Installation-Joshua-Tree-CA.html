You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and performance if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>

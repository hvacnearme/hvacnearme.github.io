Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

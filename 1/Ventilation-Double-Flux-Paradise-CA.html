<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

People at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma.

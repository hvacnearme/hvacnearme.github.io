<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing product acquired with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the examination on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health hazard reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new property owner I have found out how to determine the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

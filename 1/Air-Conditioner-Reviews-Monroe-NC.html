<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner.

Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>

The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are required to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running.

Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>

<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

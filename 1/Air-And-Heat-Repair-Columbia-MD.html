<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

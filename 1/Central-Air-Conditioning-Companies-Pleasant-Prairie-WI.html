<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>

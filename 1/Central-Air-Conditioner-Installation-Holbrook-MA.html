<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater does not produce its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as gas, coal, or oil. Rather, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Additionally, a geothermal heating and cooling system utilizes substantially less electricity compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, providing a positive influence on the environment.<p>
<p>Before you begin installing the real duct, it is very essential to plan out your duct configuration in order to make sure that there is enough room in the walls, floors, and ceilings to run your duct work and that there is enough area in each room of your home to connect the heater.

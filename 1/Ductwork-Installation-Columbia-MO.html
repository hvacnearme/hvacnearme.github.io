<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

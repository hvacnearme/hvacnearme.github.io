Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>

The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

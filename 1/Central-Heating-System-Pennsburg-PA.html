<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part.

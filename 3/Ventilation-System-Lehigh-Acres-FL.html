Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the start. However then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>

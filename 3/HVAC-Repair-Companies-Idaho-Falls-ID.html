<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the entire surface area of a flooring heats up the lower half of the room, enveloping occupants in warmth at a lower total temperature-- in some cases approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating system." In other words, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of comfort. And, as different public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenses.<p>

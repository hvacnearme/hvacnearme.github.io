<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>

For instance, human beings breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not poisonous, but may become hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to collect. Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system.

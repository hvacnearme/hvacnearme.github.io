<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Pleasant Hill IA</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being much more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are typically installed in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

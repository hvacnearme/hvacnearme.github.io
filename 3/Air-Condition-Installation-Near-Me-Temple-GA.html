<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But many of the things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their houses and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is frosty. Likewise, if the a/c unit smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be heated up in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a couple of feet listed below ground. In the summertime, the procedure reverses, thus cooling a house by eliminating heat. Underground temperature level stays constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer dependable and consistent heating & cooling.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that need to be continually provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>

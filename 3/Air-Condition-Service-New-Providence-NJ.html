<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites need to discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a vicious, vicious summer.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

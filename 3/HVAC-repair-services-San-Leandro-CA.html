<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

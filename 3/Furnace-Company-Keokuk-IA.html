<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical power, a heat pump is a cost-efficient solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, however in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate environment, where the temperature does not get too low or too high. In other words, they are best for our Seattle environment! They are highly effective, beating out most other kinds of heating systems in performance.

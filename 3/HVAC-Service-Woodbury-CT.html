<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Woodbury Connecticut</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

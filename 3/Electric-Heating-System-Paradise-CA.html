<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>

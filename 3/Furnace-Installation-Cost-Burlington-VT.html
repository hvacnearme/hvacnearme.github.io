<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Burlington VT</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>There are numerous variables that contribute to indoor air pollution. Such factors include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas given off by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c before you purchase.

The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

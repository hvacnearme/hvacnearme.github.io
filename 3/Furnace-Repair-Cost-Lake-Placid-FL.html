<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips.

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Coventry RI Home</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

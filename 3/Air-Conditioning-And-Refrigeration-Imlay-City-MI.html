<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>

In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same.

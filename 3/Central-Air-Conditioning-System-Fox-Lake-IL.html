<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

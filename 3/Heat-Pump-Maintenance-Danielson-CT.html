Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

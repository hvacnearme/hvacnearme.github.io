And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>

Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers.

<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

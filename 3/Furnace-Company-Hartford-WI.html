<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no impurity sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air.

<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Hartford WI</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Electric glowing floor heating unit lend themselves well to renovations, although they're frequently used in new house building. Electric systems are available in a number of different applications and elegance. Some are as simple as thin, electric mats.

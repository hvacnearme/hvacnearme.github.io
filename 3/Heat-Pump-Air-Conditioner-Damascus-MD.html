<p>The use of air filters can trap some of the air toxins.

<p>To be honest, few of the facilities managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us for that reason. Generally they were initially thinking about from another location monitoring some other element of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs.

<p>A customized air conditioner that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>

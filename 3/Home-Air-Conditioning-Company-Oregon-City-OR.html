<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed simply a few years earlier.<p>
<p>This handbook explains the WH-1. Active, direct systems. (See System Diagram). The Design Sun Ray WH-1. is an active, direct system.

The WH-1 is designed for installation in areas where the air temperature level falling listed below 41 Â° F does not take place more than 3 to 4 times every year and this low temperature does not exceed an 8-hour period.<p>

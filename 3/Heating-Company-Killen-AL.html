<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

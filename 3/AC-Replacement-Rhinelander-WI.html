<p>Air toxins can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burned off.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

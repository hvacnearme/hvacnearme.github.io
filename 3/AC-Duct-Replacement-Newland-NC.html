<p>Simplify your services, make more services revenue, and provide an incredible customer experience. To ensure the unit you choose is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation quote to identify the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's just right for your home-we do not simply replace it with the very same size unit you presently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the system isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can normally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

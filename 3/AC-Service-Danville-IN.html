<p>We take a look at hints before we supply guidance to change instead of repair a heater. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>

If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up.

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>

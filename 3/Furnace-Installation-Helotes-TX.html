<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this.

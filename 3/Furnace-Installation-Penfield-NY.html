<p>The heat pump acquired popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air inside. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate environments, but with enhancements in low temperature operation and lowered loads due to more effective homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates.<p>

<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>

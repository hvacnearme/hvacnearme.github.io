<p>The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often vital to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information may identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping track of information may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>

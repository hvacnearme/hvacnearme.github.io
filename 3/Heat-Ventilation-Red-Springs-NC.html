<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>

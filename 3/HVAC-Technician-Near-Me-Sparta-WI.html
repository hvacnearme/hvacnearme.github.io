<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>You must constantly employ an expert to conduct AC repair, for the exact same factor that you trust a professional plumbing technician or electrical expert.

Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the location using established health department suggestions.<p>

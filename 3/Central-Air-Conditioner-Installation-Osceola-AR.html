Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve).

If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>

<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Grant MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

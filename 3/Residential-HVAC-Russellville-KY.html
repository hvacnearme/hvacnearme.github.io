<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in surprise or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area using recognized health department suggestions.<p>

<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to examine and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the exact same period.

The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri.

<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>

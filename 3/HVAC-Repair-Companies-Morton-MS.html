(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide advice to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>

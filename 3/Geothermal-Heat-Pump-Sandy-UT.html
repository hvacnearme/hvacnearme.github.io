<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Pollutants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air contaminant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care items. Bacteria and infections, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

The structure type consisted of both residential and commercial. The majority of samples examined were evaluated positive for fungis and germs.<p>

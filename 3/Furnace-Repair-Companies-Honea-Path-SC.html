Although temperatures are often in the comfort variety, some professional treatments, such as open heart surgery, need low temperatures (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, reasonably heats (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both convenience and procedure applications, the goal may be to not just control temperature, but also humidity, air quality, and air motion from area to area.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

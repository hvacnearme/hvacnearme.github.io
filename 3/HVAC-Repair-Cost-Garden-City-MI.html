<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

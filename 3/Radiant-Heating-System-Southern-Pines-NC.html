<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

However, select your contractor wisely, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same).

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the existing one expired. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>

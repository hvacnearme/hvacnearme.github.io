<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on.

The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

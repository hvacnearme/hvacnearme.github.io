<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect.

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the skills or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this enter the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple rooms at once, but are not really energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>

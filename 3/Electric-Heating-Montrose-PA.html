<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Montrose PA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

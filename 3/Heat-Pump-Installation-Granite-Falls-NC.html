<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate adequate amounts of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or positioned in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly situated outside air intake vents can also bring in air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a portion effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>

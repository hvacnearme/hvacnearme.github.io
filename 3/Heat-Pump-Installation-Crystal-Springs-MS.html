In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

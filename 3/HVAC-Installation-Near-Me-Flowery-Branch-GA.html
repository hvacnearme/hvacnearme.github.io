Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular illness have been linked to specific air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause instant signs but can cause cancer after many years.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, supplying a comfy climate in every space.

<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out.

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>

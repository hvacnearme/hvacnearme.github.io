PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

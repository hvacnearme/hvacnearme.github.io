<p>These guys have been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a house might cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these people twice. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>

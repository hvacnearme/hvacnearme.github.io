<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Dover FL</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your automobile.

Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

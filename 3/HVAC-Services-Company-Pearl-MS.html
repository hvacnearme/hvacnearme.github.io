<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

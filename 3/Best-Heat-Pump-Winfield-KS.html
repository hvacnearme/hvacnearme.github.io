<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in big commercial buildings can not be effectively determined or corrected without a thorough building investigation. These investigations might begin with written surveys and telephone consultations in which structure detectives examine the history of resident signs and structure operation treatments. In some cases, these questions might quickly discover the problem and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and structure residents may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace machines, cleaning items, building activities, furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside pollutants. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>

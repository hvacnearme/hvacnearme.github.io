<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Mcloud OK</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

If you do not get your system inspected, you won't notice an issue till it stops working in the middle of winter season.

Routine inspection and maintenance also assists keep it in great shape and lengthens its life.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

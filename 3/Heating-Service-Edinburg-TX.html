<p>These principles-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- might already be altering. Though only 33 percent of Seattle real estate systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new real estate units have been built in the 4 years since or are presently under building and construction.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

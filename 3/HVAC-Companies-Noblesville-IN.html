<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can show your house may not have sufficient ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To identify odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>

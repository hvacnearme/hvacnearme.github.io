<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

Consult your state health or housing department for suggestions on which private laboratories or public agencies may have the ability to help check your house for lead in paint.

<p>Old furnaces typically begin to make some unusual sounds as they get towards the end of their life.

<h3>HVAC Repair Cost in Pikeville KY 41501</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they identified the concern and repaired very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>When your home's furnace stops working, your house can have more problems than just being unpleasant. Every moment that your heating system is off also places your pipes at the threat of freezing.

<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

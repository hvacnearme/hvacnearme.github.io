<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These items present a risk only when they are handled in a manner that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become air-borne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can lead to the capacity for significant illness.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

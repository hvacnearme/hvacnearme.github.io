<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up.

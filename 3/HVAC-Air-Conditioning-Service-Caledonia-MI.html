<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that best temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service strategy which usually consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, people exhale carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not hazardous, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms might also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread out throughout the entire office or structure by ways of the ventilation system.<p>

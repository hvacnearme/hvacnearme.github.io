In general, it has been an excellent experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. But then understood A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>

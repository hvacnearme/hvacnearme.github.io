<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

Also, clean ducts and correct air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician examine the system occasionally.<p>

In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>

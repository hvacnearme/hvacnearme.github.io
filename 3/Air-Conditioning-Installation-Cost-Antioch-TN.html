These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, electrical power or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

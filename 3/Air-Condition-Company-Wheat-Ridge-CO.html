<p>There are 2 main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating business. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>

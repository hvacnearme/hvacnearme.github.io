<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>

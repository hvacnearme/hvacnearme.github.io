<h3>AC Compressor in Roslindale MA 02131</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average wages for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites should find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a terrible, harsh summer season.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who described our alternatives did an excellent job in making certain we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. The technicians who installed the brand-new system were quick and professional, while requiring time to make certain we understood how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>

<h3>Central Heating System in Westfield Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Some HVAC technicians sell service agreements to their customers, providing regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

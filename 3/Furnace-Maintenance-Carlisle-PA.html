<p>Numerous detach blocks consist of two cartridge merges. Inspect them before you continue with repairs (Image 3). A blown fuse is a sign of a failing part inside the condensing unit.

<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

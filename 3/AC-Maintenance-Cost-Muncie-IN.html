<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how hazardous lead might be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

<p>When installing radiant heat, you must provide severe thought to the type of floor covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well because it performs and shops heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, however work reasonably well. Carpeting will directly insulate the flooring from the space, reducing efficiency, so if you wish to set up carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with thick cushioning.<p>
<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

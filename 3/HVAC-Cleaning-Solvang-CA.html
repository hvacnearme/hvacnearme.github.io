<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>

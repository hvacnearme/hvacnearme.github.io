The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and assists tire them from the home.<p>

<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work correctly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

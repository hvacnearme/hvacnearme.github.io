<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

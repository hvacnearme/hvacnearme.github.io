<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Venice CA 90291</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

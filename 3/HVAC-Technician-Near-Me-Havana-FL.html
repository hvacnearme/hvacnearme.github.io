For example, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to take into account when trying to find out how frequently I need to change my a/c filters.

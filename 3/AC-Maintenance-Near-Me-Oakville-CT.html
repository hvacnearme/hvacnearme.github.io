<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Oakville CT</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

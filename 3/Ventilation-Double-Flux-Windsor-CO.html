<p>Let's begin by detailing the planning that requires to occur prior to you actually buy a furnace. Picking a furnace for your house isn't as basic as picking one off a display room floor. Not all furnaces are good for all homes, and there are a number of elements that definitely need to be considered before choosing one. First, you'll need one that is appropriately sized for your home. A furnace that is too large will put out too much heat for your system to deal with, and will trigger problems like short-cycling that can shorten its life. A furnace that is too little, on the other hand, will not have the ability to supply sufficient heat to keep your house comfortable.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you set up, it's essential that it's sized properly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the amount of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your home won't be heated up properly and the system will need to constantly run to attempt to heat the whole house, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up.

There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

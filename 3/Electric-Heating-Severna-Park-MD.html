<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

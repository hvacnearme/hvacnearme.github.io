<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Having a wood-burning heater can be incredibly effective in regards to cost. If you have access to inexpensive or free firewood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it may not cost you anything.

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

(He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out.

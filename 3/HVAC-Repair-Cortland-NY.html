After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Generally the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this area.<p>

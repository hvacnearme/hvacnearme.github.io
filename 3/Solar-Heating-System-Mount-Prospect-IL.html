<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

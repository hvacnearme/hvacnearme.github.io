<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter season can intensify problems. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be lurking in your environments.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.

The Policy prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out.

He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we may want to have actually carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

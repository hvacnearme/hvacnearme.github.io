<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is calculated utilizing the very same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The typical summer temperature level to arrive at the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to come to the proper SEER score for your area, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning units made in the United States.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>

<p>First make sure the air filter is clean and in excellent condition if you observe a decline in heat output. Next, check other components of the furnace for any build-up of particles, dirt and dust, an economical repair that can help increase performance. Likewise, examine the vents and ducts for obstruction. Lastly, ensure the thermostat is working and positioned appropriately. Attempt moving it away from direct sunlight given that this may affect temperature readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your house. If this takes place, your thermostat will turn off the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold. You may also need to examine your insulation to make certain that warm air does not escape from your area through different openings.<p>

<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Matthews North Carolina</h3>
<p>If your air conditioner is more than eight years old, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's an easy issue like particles obstructing the condenser unit or a worn fan belt.

A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Grafton WI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

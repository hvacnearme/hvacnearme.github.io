<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and might cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes nose, throat, and eye inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort.

<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat irritant might cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are managed in a method that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these items present a risk only. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become air-borne if proper controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for substantial health issue.<p>

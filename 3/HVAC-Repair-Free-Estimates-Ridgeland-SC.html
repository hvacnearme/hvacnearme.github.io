<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Ridgeland SC</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Piedmont SC</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing clever technology. Martin stated the company can establish a control panel within the building's controls that will offer information on its systems to permit real time presence, providing the capability to be preventative rather than reactionary.

<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>

<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Canal Fulton OH Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run continuously is because something is clogged or unclean Before trying to repair any problem, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan".

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

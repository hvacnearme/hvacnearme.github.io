<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

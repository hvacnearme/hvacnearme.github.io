<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include delays in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, babies, and kids are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead.

<h3>Heating Company in Ada MI 49301</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Martin stated the company is prepared to put down roots" in the Tri-Cities and expects to have a group of about 7 to 10 employees when it opens the doors on the new facility by early fall.

If micro-organisms do establish, they might spread out throughout the entire office or building by ways of the ventilation system.<p>

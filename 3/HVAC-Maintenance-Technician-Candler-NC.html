<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room.

As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

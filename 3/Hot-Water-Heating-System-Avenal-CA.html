<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common building materials used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Elimination of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum because the fibers can be spread out into the air during the removal procedure. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is frequently suggested instead.<p>

Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

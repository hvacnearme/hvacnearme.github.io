<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

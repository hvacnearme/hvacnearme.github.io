<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace in Dade City FL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a reference later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

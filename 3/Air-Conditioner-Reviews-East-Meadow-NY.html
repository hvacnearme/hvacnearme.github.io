<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

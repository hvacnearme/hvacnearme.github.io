<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>

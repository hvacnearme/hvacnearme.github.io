Frequently discovered office toxins and their sources. consist of environmental tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building supplies; formaldehyde from pressed wood products; other organics from building materials, carpet, and other office furnishings, cleaning activities and materials, toilet air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and printing shop; biological pollutants from dirty ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years before that.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those dimensions on hand when shopping for an a/c to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window.

<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my needs completely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra products.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>

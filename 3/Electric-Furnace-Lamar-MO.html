<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

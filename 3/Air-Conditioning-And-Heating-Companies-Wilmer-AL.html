<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

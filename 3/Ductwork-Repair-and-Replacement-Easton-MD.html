<p>Although installation is easy and does not need much time, attempting this job is not an excellent idea.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

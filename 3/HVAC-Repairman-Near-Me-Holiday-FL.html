<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, infants, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the destructive results of lead. Kids may have greater exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Holiday FL</h3>
<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My partner stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have actually satisfied in a very long time.

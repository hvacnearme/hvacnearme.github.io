<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>

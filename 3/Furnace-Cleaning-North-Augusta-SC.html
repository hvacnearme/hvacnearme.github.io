<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in North Augusta SC</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air distributing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Since an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>The homes and composition of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

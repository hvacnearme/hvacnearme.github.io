After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance.

Since it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>

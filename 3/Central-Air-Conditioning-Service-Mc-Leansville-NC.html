Based on the average temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a cars and truck it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years. Your heating unit will work hard for you, but like your cars and truck, doing regular and routine maintenance will keep it running efficiently, avoid problems, and keep your guarantee intact.<p>
<p>Through typical use and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner might end up being very dirty. These elements of the devices are crucial for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans up all elements, and inspects connections to ensure they are safe and secure. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic parts are examineded for appropriate function and total condition. This is an excellent opportunity to recognize parts that are worn or malfunctioning. When the problem is fairly minor, changing them to fix the air conditioning may be a lot less expensive.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option.

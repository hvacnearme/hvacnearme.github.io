<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently might be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>

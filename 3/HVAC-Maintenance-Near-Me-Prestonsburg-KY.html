This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

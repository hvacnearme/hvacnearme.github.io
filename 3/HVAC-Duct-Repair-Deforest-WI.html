<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

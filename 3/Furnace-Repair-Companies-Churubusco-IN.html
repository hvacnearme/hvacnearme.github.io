<h3>AC Compressor in Churubusco IN 46723</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on uncommon occasions.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

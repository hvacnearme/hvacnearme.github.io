The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right now, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Fairview Heights IL</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

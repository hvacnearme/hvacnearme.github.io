<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Mount Vernon IN</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the various houses they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condos, row housing, etc.). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, sufficient air flow (ventilation), correct purification, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is operating safely and not contributing to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Both must be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

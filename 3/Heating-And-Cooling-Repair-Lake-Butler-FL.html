<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the evaluation on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new resident I have learned how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

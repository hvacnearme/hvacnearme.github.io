Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Clyde OH Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

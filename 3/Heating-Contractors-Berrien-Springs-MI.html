There can be a severe danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that many people can take both to decrease the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to assist you choose whether to take actions that can minimize the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

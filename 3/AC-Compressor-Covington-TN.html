<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Covington TN HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater since the technicians thought they simply didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

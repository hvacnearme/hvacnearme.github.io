These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electricity or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

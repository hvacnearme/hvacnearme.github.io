While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

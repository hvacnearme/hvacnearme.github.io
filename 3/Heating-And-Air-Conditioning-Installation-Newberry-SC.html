<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil change in your automobile. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>

<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems at Newberry SC</h3>
<p>Many people understand that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can likewise have considerable, hazardous effect. EPA research studies of human exposure to air contaminants indicate that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the leading 5 environmental health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

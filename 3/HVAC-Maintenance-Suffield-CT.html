<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Because 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has allowed just the use of plywood and particleboard that conform to defined formaldehyde emission limitations in the building of upraised and mobile houses. In the past, some of these homes had raised levels of formaldehyde since of the large quantity of high-emitting pressed wood items utilized in their building and since of their relatively small interior area.<p>

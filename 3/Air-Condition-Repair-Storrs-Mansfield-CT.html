This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio.

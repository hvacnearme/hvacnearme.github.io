<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

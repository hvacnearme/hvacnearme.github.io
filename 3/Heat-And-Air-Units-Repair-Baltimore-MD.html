<p>Iâ $ m truly fussy with my things. I like my equipment and appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>

Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

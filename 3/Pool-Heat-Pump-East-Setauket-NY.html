<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have actually been effectively dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

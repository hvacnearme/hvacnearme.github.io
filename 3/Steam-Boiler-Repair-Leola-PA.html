<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

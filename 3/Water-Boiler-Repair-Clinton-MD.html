<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work completely unless you do this.<p>

Don't have time for a fast rinse? A minimum of wash your hands to remove lingering pollen, especially before making contact with food or your face, suggests the Asthma and Allergy Structure of America.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

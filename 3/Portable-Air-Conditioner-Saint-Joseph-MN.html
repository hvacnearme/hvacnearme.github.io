<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters.

Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.

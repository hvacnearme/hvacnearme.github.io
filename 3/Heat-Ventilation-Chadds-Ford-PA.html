<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in location. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided.

For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early wear and tear, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a really advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>

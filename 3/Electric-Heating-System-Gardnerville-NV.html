This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum versatility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Seattle heating systems can run nine months of the year. Based on the typical temperature levels in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a car it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years.

<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in.

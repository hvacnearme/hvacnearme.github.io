<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

Location the a/c unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only factor for high bills. Furnaces typically lose their effectiveness as they age, specifically if they have not been appropriately kept.

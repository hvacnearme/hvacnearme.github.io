Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>

<p>Because pesticides can be discovered far from the site of their initial application, it is sensible to decrease using chemical pesticides outdoors as well as inside. Depending on the site and insect to be managed, several of the following actions can be effective: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and frequent cleaning of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be decreased or prevented by making certain that wooden structure materials do not enter direct contact with the soil and by saving fire wood far from the home. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be dramatically minimized.<p>

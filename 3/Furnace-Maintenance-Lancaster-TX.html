<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a warm water supply.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a really typical repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance because the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

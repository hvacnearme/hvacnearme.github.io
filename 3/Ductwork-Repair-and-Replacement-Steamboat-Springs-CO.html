<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

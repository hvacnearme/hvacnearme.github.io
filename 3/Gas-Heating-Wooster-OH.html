This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Larchmont NY</h3>

If your HVAC unit is not draining properly, you'll have a water leak. A restriction in your drain pipelines triggers a water leak. There are several places a clog can happen. One of the main areas where blockages begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

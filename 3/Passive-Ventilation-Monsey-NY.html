<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.

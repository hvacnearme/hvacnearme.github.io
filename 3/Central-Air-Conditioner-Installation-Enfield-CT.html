<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Fantastic AC Repair Company in Enfield CT</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great.

He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

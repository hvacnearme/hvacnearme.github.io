The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future.

Inappropriate modification, frequently suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you purchase a brand-new gas stove or variety. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your house. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>

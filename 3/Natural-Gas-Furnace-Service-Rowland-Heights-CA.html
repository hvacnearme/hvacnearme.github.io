<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial structures, apartment buildings and huge homes. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, since the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and wear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department recommendations.<p>

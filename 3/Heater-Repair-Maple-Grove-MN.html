<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is honest, reliable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

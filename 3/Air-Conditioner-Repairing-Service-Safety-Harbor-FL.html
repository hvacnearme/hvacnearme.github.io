<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

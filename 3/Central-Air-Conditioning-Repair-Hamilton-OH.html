<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.

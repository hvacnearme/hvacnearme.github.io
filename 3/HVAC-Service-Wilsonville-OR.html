<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Wilsonville OR</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

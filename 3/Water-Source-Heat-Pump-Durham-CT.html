<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, though, there will always be the odd issue that occasionally shows up. It is really essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do observe your furnace behaving oddly. The faster you respond to concerns with your furnace, the much easier they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will just make the problem worse, and frequently more expensive.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>The reality is, air contamination in your home can be just as bad - and even worse - than it is outdoors.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

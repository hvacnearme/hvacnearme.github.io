<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that ideal temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the roadway.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>

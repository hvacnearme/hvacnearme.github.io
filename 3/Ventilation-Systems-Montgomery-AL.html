<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater.

<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends on individual sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>

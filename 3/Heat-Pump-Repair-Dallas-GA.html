The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, the majority of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption.

More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>

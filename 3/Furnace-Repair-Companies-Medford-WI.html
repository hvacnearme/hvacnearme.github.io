<p>. Prior to choosing the installation place of a/c unit, several main elements need to be considered. Firstly, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units should not fall on the location of rest or work area.

The outdoor unit needs to also be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be effectively released outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is highly recommended to install the air conditioner units in quickly available locations, for more maintenance during operation.<p>

<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to replace two furnaces in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as constructing materials, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can launch toxins basically continuously.

Malfunctioning or unvented home appliances or incorrectly used items can release higher and in some cases unsafe levels of contaminants inside.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>When deciding which of the finest AC units they must set up in their houses, there are a few main things that house owners will want to take into consideration. It actually depends on what you value the most in a leading brand name central air conditioner. The major elements for many house owners will be the total cost to set up the best air conditioner brands, life-span of the AC system, warranties used, energy effectiveness (SEER scores), and size of the unit you require for your home's square footage (HEAPS) to effectively cool your house.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>

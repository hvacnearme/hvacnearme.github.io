<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that an effective wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet.

<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, these days. While many individuals presume contamination is just an outdoor problem, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not believe sufficient about exposure to all the things we position in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the home from home plumbing that is made with lead products.

Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>

<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

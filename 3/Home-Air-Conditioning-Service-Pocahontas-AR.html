<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>

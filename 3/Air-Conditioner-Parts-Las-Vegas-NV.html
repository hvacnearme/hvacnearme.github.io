<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

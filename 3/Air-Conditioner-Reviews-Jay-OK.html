They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to purchase it. My better half stated that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

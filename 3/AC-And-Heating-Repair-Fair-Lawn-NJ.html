<h3>HVAC Filters in Fair Lawn NJ 07410</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>

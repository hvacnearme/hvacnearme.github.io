<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual areas.<p>

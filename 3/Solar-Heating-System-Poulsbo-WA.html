<p>Though it may be difficult to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not only filthy up the air, but lead to other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building materials add to bad air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers.

<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold.

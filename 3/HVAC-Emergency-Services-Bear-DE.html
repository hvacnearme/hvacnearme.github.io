<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow.

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work.

No extra charge.<p>

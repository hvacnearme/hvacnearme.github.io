<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant.

No extra charge.<p>

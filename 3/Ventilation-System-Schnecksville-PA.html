Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

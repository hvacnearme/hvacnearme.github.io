<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, since it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years ago and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>

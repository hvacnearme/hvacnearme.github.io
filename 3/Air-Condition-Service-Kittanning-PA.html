<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

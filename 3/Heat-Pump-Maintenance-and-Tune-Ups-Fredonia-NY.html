<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>

<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Having annual maintenance performed on the furnace is a great idea if you want to conserve yourself time and cash over the long term. Throughout a maintenance check out, the technician will examine and clean all of the working parts of your furnace and repair any minor damage that has the potential to trigger larger problems.

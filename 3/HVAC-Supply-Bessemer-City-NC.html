<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, until the mandate for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under several owners. Goodrich's dad was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils.

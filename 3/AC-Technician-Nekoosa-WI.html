<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

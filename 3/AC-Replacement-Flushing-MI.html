<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are readily available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Support! Climate Pro is dependable and really cared about us and our circumstance. We got back one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated house once again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

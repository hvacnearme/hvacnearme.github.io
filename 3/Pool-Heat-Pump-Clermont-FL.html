<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

<p>I am an investor, I need to replace 2 furnaces in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as building products, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch pollutants more or less continuously. Other sources, associated to activities like smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies launch pollutants intermittently. Unvented or malfunctioning appliances or incorrectly used items can launch greater and sometimes hazardous levels of contaminants inside.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include delays in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and ought to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal.

<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in York ME</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually identified the difficulty location in looking over the expense. He resolved the concern in one day, had changed the expense to what I thought about fair before he called back, understood what may have caused the issue and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not occur again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>

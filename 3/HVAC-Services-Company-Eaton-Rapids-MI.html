For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside.

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>

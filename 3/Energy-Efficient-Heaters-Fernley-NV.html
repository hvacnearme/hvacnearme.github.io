<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC.

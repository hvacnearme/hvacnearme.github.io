<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>

<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the possible to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to examine and, if needed, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Contagious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of health problems triggered by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you prior to you understand it remains in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes moderate impacts that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These signs include headaches, dizziness, nausea, disorientation and fatigue. The effects of CO exposure can differ greatly from individual to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>

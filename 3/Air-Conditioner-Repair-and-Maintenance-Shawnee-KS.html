Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

<p>The heatpump got popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from different sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air within. At first, heatpump HVAC systems were just utilized in moderate environments, however with improvements in low temperature level operation and decreased loads due to more effective homes, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

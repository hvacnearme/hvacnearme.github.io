<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Clarkston WA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>

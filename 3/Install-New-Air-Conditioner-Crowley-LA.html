<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects toxins from indoor air (expressed as a portion effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c fails, start by inspecting any fuses or breaker. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>

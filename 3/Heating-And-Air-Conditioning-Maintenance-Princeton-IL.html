<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

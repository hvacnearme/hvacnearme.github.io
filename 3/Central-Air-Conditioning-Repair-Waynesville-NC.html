<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Power Vac America supplies commercial, commercial, institutional, residential and marine duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The key portion of your air conditioning is the outdoor system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its positioning on your residential or commercial property and its maintenance, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter season. Most of the time, this just includes some accumulation of dirt and debris, which is pretty basic to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the unit and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or excessive wear to the exterior. They might recommend that you trim overgrown trees or bushes to guarantee appropriate airflow around the system.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down completely. By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

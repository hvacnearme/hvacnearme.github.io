<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in.

Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

Micro-organisms or bacteria may also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>

<p>Use professionals and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated specialists perform far better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings exhale carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not poisonous, but may become hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Micro-organisms or germs may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by means of the ventilation system.<p>

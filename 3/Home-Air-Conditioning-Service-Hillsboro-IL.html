<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years back and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>

<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Air conditioner makers typically make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c unit stops working, start by inspecting any merges or breaker.

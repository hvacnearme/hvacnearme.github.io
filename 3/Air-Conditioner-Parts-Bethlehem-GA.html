Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>

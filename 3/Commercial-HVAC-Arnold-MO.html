<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>

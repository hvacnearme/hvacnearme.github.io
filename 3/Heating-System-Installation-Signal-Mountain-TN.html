<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn offered fantastic customer support at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance tasks we may want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better option.

But more complex issues-- identified by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the three methods below might be suitable.<p>

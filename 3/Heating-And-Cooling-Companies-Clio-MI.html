<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has identified structure materials, home furnishings, and mold as major issues, but much of the risk likewise originates from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can show your house might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To discover odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may pick to replace the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it might be wiser to change the whole system.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

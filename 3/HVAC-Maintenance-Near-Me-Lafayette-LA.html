<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Lafayette LA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install examination results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

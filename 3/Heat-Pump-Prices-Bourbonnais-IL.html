<h3>Solar Heating System in Bourbonnais Illinois</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

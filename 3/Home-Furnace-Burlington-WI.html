<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>

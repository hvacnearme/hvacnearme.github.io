<p>Energy performance can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is really vital to maintaining a correct temperature.<p>
<p>Outside impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Specialists suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

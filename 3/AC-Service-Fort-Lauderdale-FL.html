<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most economical if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

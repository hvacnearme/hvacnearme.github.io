<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Clearlake CA Home</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>Working of an HVAC System in New Hope PA</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

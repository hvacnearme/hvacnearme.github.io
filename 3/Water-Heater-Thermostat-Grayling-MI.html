<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>

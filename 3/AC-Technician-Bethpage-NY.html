<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>

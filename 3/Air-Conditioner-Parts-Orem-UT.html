<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

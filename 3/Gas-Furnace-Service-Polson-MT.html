<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

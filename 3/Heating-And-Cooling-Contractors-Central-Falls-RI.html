While pollutants commonly discovered in indoor air can trigger lots of hazardous results, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are necessary to produce specific illness. People also respond really differently to direct exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research is needed to much better understand which health impacts happen after direct exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations found in houses and which happens from the greater concentrations that occur for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon ends up being trapped in structures and concentrations build up inside.<p>

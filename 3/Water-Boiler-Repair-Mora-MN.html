What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

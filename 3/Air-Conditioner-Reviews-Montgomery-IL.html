<h3>Gas Central Heating in Montgomery IL 60538</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

These combustion products might lead to throat, nose, and eye irritation; tiredness; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

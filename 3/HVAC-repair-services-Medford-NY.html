Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air within.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

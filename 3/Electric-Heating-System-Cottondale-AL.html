<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers.

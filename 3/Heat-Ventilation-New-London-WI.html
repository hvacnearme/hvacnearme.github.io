<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Company in New London</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold may be residing in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But a number of the things individuals do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their houses and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not restricted to houses. In truth, numerous office buildings have substantial air pollution sources Some of these buildings may be improperly ventilated. For instance, mechanical ventilation systems may not be designed or run to provide appropriate quantities of outside air. Finally, people typically have less control over the indoor environment in their workplaces than they perform in their homes. As an outcome, there has been a boost in the occurrence of reported illness.<p>

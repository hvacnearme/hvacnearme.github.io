<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>

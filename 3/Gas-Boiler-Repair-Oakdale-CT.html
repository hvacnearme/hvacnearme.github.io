<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

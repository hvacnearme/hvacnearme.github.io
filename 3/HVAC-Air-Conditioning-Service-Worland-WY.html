Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

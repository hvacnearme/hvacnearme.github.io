For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.. a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>

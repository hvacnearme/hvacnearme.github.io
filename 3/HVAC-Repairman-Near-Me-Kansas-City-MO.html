<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from procedures or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents.

<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your West Memphis AR Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

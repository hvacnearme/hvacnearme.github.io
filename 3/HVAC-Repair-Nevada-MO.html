<p>Oil heating systems are generally not very effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however a lot of do not attain an effectiveness greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.

<p>Recent Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They met my needs completely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the essential examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>

<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>

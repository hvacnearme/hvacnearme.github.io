<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

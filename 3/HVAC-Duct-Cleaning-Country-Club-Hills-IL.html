<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Country Club Hills IL 60478</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we offer advice to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

It's a scientific method of determining how much energy the system moves versus how much it utilizes. Many geothermal heat pump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

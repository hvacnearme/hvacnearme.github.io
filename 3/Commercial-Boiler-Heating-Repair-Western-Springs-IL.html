The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>A hydronic heating system, otherwise referred to as radiant heat, can help you conserve cash. The system is especially affordable for off-the-grid houses and homes in locations with expensive electrical power. The system utilizes various energy sources; it can depend on basic gas- or oil-fired boilers, wood-fired boilers, solar water heaters, or any combination of these systems. The system works in an energy-efficient way, and will reduce expenditures each month.<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power relies on routine sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and offered source of energy.<p>

<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo searches for more than just additional revenue or scale when it makes acquisitions - it looks for companies that can broaden Pueblo's client base or provide a brand-new line of services. For example, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo performed minimal plumbing work for select clients. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its abilities, making it possible for an enhanced value proposal for a wider set of clients.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

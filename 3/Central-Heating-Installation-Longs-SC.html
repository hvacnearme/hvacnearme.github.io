<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
<h3>AC Repair Cost in Longs South Carolina</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas heaters While oil is traditionally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the exact same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works however your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Longs SC 29568</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

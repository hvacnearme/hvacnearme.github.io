<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>

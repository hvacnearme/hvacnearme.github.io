<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors.

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC companies will evaluate things like specialized filter modifications throughout Preventative Maintenance visits, independently, as an include on service for you.

<p>Consider buying an energy-efficient design if your air conditioner is old.

<p>If your single phase a/c unit isn't old adequate to validate replacement, think about an entire house dehumidifier.

The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and enabling greater comfort at greater temperatures.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to supply enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

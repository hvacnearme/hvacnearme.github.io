<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, until the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production.

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

No 2 systems are exactly the same, however filter modifications are something we offer during PM visits if the client needs it- particularly the unattainable filters- since we know how crucial it is that they be changed out & how difficult it can be for a property owner to do it.<p>

Trace was on time, considerate, and appreciated my house by constantly wearing boot coverings when entering my home. He demonstrated the points of examination and also suggested I have a UV light installed due to a little accumulation of mold building up in the air handler, which he completely examined and cleaned up the exterior compressor coils as well as ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by utilizing a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also eliminated the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor system and advised an option to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I received a detailed email report of the assessment outlining all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I highly advise him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

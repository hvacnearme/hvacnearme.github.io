Depending on its placement on your residential or commercial property and its upkeep, it may sustain some damage throughout the winter. The majority of the time, this simply includes some accumulation of dirt and debris, which is quite easy to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the exterior of the unit and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or extreme wear to the exterior.

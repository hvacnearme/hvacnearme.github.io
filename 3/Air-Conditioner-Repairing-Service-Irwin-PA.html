<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may pick to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. However, considering current changes in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be smarter to change the whole system.<p>

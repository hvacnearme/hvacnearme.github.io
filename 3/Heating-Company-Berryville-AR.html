<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was type of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved problems. I would recommend this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely practical in gathering details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>

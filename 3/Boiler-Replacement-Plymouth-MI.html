<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians believed they simply didn't appear right and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

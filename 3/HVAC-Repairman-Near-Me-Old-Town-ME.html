<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was sort of strange being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>We frequently set up little built-in electric space heaters when we redesign or include on a space. Unlike heat pumps, these systems are self-contained. They are also safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heaters. They can be found in many different kinds: wall-mounted units that are fantastic for little spaces like bathrooms, cove heaters that resemble baseboard heating systems but are tucked securely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted radiant heat panels that offer a mild sunshine-like heat from above.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Morris Plains NJ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves checking the recommended connections as well as temperature level and pressure determines. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are protected and tight.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they need to be positioned. A lot of commonly they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people mostly remain seated in that particular location. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensor appropriately. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>

<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).

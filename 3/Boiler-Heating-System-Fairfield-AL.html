<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>

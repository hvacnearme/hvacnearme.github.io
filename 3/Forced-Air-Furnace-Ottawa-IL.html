<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

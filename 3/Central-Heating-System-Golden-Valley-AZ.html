<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, cruel summertime.<p>

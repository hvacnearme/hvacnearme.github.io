<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>

We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>

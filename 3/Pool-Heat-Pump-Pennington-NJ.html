<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is utilized to carry the heat to the rooms. Most modern-day hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>

<p>Among the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to set up, especially in an older house. Depending on the type of unit set up, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're highly allergic to dust.

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside. When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to install.

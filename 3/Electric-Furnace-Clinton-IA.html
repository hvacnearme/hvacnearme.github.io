<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

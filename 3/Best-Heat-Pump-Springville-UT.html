<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>

<p>All The Time Air Conditioning is as promised: available instantly to offer exceptional service. Ilan Cohavi, the owner, works nicely and effectively to provide a completed project in record time. He installed 3 Nest Learning Thermostats in my home. His understanding of the item was outstanding. His workmanship was exceptional and he didn't leave a mess. The reward: he is a really pleasant person to deal with, and is very eager to finish the work based on the specs of his client. I would extremely advise him for all your HVAC needs.<p>
<p>The primary factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services used. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a maker's warranty. Any major repairs ought to be covered under the producer's service warranty. Nevertheless, some makers need routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you each time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>

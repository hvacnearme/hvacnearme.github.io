Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>There's a big distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of home heating-- convection.

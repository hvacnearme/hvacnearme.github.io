Extra weatherization procedures should not be carried out till these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.

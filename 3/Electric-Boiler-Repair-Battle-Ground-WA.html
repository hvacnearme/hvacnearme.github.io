<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

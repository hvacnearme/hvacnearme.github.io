<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.

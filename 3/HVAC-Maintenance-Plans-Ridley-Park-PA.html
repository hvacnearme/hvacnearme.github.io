<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is much more than other heat pump types when installing the whole system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with your house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health risk reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new resident I have actually discovered how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

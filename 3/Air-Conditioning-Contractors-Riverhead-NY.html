<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>

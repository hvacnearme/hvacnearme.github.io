<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>

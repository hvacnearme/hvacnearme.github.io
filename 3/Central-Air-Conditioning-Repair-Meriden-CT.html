<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Prior to it was known how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>

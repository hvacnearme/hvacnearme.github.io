<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>

If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

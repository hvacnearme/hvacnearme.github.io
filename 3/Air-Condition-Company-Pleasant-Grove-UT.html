<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Pleasant Grove UT</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to check AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Fountain Inn SC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your ac system and heat pump must be devoid of all blockages and particles. Blockages can obstruct the flow of condensed water and trigger wetness accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, irregular temperature level regulation, bacteria, and compromised air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to ensure all excess moisture streams away from the system.<p>

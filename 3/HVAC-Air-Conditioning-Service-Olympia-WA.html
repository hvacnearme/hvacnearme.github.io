<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Olympia WA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

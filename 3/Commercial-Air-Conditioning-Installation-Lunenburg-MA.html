<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

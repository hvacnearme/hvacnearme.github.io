<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up examination results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a cruel, harsh summer season.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing everything to me.

<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>

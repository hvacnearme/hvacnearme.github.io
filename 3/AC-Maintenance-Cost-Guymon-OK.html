<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

<p>Some sources, such as constructing products, home furnishings, and home products like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less continuously. Other sources, associated to activities performed in the house, release toxins intermittently.

High pollutant concentrations can remain in the air for long periods after some of these activities.<p>

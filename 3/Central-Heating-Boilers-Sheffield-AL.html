<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is permitted to rise and flow out high building openings to the outside (stack effect ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings.

Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition areas, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>

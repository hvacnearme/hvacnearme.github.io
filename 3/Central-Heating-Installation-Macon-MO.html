<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-404a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

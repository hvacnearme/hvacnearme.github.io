Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).

Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>

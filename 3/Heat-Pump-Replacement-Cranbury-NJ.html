<p>Buildings are created or planned to respond actively to a few of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and maintain surface areas to boost their longevity, look, or efficiency. In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps drastically modify buildings in ways that might be very important to their own integrity or their effect on building occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We might find it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, particularly, some of the methods utilized by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>. Prior to picking the installation place of air conditioning system, several primary factors need to be considered.

The outdoor unit needs to also be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be successfully discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop greatly. It is extremely suggested to set up the a/c units in easily accessible places, for more maintenance throughout operation.<p>

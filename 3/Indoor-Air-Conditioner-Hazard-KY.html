Improper change, frequently indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you purchase a new gas range or variety. Never use a gas stove to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>

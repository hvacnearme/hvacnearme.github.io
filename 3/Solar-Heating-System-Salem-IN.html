<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

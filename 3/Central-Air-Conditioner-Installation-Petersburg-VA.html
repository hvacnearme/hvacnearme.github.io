<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air).

Many common structure products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Since the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the elimination process, elimination of asbestos-containing products is not always ideal. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is often advised instead.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>To be truthful, few of the centers supervisors who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us for that reason. More often than not they were at first interested in remotely keeping track of some other element of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't till later on, as they continued working with us, that they discovered and carried out indoor air quality keeping an eye on to provide a much healthier, much safer building environment-- and to avoid the negative consequences connected with indoor air contaminants.<p>

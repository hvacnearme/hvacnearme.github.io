<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Another repair indication is whether you needed to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below absolutely no night.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil furnaces are gas heaters While oil is generally utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the exact same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The genuine advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

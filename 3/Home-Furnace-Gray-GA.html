POLICE rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result. The majority of ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>

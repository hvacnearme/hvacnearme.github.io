<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Navarre OH</h3>
<p>Most people don't know how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC unit is not draining correctly. A limitation in your drain pipes causes a water leak. There are many different places a clog can take place. One of the main areas where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>

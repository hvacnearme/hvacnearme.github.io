<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, human beings exhale co2, which in little quantities is not toxic, but might become dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to collect. Bacteria or micro-organisms might also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the whole office or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>

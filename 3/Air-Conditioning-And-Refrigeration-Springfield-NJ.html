<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a few years back.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely specify the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that ought to be continuously supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>

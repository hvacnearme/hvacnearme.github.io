<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

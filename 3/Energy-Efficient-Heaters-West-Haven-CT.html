<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace need to also be checked routinely. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire danger.

<h3>Forced Air Furnace in West Haven CT 06516</h3>
<p>To figure out the appropriate size of oil furnace you need for your home, determine the home's square footage and identify what zone your house is in.

Multiply the length and width of each space in your house that you heat and add up all the spaces together to get your total square footage.<p>
<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your home, however there are many other contaminants that can not just filthy up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products add to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unstable organic substances) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to provide threshold informs. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to fix the scenario right away.<p>

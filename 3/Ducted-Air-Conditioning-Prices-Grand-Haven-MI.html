<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on private level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from individual to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Protected individual removed cables to the floor utilizing little blobs of hot-melt glue. Carefully cut and get rid of the orange mesh to free the cable television. Do this to work around angles, obstacles and areas where full-width mats won't fit. Do not overlap the cable. When the whole mat is fitted and set up, press it securely into the tape and hot-melt glue any loose ends or bulges in the mat. Perform a resistance test to check for damage.<p>

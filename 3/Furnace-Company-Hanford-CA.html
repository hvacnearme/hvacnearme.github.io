<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Hanford CA</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as different as the different homes they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile homes, houses, high-rise condos, row housing, etc.). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, sufficient air circulation (ventilation), proper filtration, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running securely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

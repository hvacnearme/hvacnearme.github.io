<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power should not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%.

Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

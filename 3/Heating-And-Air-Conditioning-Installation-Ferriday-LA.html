<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

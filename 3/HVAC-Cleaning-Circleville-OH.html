<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Circleville OH 43113</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office buildings such as hospitals and high-rise buildings, lorries such as automobiles, trains, submarines, ships and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>

<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But a lot of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne contaminants in their houses and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available.

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>

<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Talbott TN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Both must be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Airborne irritants are merely a reality of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergy signs, and in some cases, trigger asthma attacks. Viruses, germs, and germs likewise can live in the air you breathe every day. These airborne toxins can affect your house convenience devices, too. Allowed to circulate through your house and your system, these and other particles can build up on the indoor coil, inhibiting air flow and decreasing heating and cooling effectiveness.

<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination.

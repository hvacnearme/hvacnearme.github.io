<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>

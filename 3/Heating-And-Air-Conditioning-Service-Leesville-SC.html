<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

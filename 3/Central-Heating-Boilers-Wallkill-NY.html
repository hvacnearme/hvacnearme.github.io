<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

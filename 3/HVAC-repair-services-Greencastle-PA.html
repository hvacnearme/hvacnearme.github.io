If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioner be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too small and your ac system won't have the ability to cool your home effectively. These are just a few of the elements that you need to take into consideration when looking for a brand-new AC system.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Cudahy WI</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

He knew just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

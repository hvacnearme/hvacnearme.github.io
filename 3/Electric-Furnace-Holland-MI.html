<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is much more than other heat pump types when installing the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one involved excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is quite expensive. Installing a brand-new geothermal heat pump to deal with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
<p>We have been extremely happy with Stability's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten completed annual maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked very well and is so efficient that it significantly decreased our energy expenditures - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we have needed them for emergencies they responded quickly and resolved the issue.<p>

<p>There are 2 main kinds of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers nose, throat, and eye irritation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

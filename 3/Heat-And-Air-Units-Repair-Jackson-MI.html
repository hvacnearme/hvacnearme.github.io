<p>PE companies tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some time.

<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company.

Review of this information may recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>

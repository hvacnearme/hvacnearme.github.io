<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering info on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>

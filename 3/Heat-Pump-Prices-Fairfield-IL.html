<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Fairfield IL?</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioning unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

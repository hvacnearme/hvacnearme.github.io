<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>

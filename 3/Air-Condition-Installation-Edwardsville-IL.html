<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing contaminants.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>

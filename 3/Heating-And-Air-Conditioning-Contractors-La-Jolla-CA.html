<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

Some structures can also use natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outdoor air introduced into a space per a system of time, and is typically expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, air-conditioning and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

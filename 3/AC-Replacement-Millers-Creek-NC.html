Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

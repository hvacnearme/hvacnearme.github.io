<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the extremely hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>

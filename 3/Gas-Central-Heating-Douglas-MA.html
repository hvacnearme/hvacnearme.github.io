<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Douglas MA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

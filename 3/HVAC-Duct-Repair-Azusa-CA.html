<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Azusa CA</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

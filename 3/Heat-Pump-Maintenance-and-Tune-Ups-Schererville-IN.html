<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain since they only partially eliminate the radon decay items and do not diminish the quantity of radon entering the house. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a trusted means of minimizing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional information on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined structure materials, furnishings, and mold as severe issues, but much of the risk likewise comes from burning things.

However, presuming they are set up properly and effectively taken care of, the probability of them having issues is small.<p>

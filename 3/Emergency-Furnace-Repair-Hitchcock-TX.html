<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated issues-- identified by consistently undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, among the 3 strategies below might be appropriate.<p>

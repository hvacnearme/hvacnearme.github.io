<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

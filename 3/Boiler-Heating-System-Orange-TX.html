<p>A customized a/c that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air course. A basic ac system transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, given that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>

<p>To secure member of the family with asthma or to lower the possibility that someone in the home may establish asthma, the home needs to be examined for prospective indoor asthma activates. Each room in the house has possible asthma triggers. Some problems can be repaired rapidly, however others might need more time and work to manage or eliminate asthma activates. Easy-to-fix problems, such as chemical odors and fragrances, add to indoor air contamination and have been known to asthma signs in sensitive people. Other sources of indoor air contamination may be more difficult to reveal. For example, using room deodorizers may mask the odor of mold. It will enhance the indoor air quality if the source of moldy smells can be found and removed.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>

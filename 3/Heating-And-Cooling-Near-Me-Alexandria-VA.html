<p>Since the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological problems.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor system. However, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it might be smarter to change the whole system.<p>

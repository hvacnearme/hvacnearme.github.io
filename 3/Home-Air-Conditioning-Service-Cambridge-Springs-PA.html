After 2 years, things began to change. There have actually been awkward noises. I got it repaired and checked. I am hoping that is completion of the concern. Overall, it has been an excellent experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. But then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>The time always comes to have your heater replaced; often it is a full 20 years after the preliminary installation and sometimes it's faster, but it constantly takes place.

<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

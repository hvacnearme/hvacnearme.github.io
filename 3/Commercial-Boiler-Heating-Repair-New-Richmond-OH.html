<p>A geothermal heating unit is more reliable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and readily available source of energy.<p>

<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality concerns. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic responsibility clause" applies.

<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences.

<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about.

Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.

For that reason, this may not be the best option for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>

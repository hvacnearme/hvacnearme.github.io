When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

For example, residential HVAC installation must be priced in a different way from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service ought to be priced in a different way from duct cleaning. If you are offering more than one service, you ought to separate these into different departments, as if they were their own separate service.<p>

<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Kenner LA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the whole surface area of a floor warms the lower half of the space, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower overall temperature-- sometimes approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit." Simply put, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of convenience. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenses.<p>

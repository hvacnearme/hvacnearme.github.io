<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

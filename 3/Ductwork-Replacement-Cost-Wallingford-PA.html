<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

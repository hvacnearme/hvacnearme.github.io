<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

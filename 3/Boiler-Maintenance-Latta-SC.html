<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

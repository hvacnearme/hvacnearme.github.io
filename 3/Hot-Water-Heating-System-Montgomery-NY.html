<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize excessive energy for the amount of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your home won't be warmed properly and the system will need to constantly run to attempt to heat the entire house, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Since they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

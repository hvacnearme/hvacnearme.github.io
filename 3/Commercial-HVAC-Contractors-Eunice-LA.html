Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen.

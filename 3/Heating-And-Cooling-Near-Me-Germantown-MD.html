<h3>Central Heating Boilers in Germantown MD 20874</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to assess circumstance & decided to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked to from beginning to end were extremely professional, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>

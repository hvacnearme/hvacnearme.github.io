<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

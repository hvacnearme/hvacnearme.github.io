<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>

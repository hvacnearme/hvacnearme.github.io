<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I went ahead and bought this Carrier and I must state it gets the job done rather well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool down your house which is among the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

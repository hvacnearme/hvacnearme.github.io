<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>

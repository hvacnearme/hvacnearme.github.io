<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

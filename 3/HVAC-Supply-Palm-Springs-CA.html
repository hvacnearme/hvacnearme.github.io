<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Palm Springs CA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>

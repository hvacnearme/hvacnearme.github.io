<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

The majority of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove impurities directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reduces direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Improper change, frequently indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a new gas stove or variety. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your home. Constantly make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>

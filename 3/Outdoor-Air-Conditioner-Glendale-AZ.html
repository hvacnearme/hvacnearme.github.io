<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is typically crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

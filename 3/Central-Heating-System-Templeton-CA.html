<p>We added a new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and needed some heating. After contacting Integrity we were offered an excellent quote on a radiant floor system.

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively solidify and cure-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>

While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>

<h3>Boiler Replacement in Lynwood CA 90262</h3>
<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by many public water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've tested the air in your home and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a lab accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon problems in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

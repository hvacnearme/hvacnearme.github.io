Gas heaters cost about the exact same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down quickly. This is a very typical repair.

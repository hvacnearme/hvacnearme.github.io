<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They include delays in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Children, fetuses, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead.

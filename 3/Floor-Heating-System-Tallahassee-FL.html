Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>

<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system manufacturers normally make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c unit stops working, begin by examining any merges or circuit breakers. Let the system cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, situated in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

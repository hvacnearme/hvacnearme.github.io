<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Watertown WI</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need relatively little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is vital to keep the system functioning efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be looked for leaks, the system ought to be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be inspected at least two times each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to get rid of dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

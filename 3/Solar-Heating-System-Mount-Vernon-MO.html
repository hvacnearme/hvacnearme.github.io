This step is necessary so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

<p>Central air systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>

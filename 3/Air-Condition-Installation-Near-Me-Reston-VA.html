<p>There are 2 main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to withstand current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>

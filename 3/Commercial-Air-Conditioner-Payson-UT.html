<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of home heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of houses in colder environments were heated up by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floors heated. In turn, the things in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>

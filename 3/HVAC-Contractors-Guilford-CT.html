<h3>How to Select An Expert HVAC Tech in Guilford CT</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

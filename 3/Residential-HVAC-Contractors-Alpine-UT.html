<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the very same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that abrupt shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

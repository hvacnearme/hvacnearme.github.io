<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy effective techniques of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures discovered just a few feet listed below ground. In the summer season, the process reverses, thereby cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level stays constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems supply trusted and constant cooling and heating.<p>
<p>You could update to the highest effectiveness equipment offered and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air prior to it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>

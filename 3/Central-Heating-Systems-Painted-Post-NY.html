<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide recommendations to change rather than repair a heater. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and effectiveness if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or exceptionally hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>

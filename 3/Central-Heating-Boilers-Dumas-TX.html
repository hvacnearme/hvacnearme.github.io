<p>Great Product! Shipment was type of weird being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtration. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants flowing through your system.

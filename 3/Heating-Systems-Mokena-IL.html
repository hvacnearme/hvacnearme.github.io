<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>

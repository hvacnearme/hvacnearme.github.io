<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

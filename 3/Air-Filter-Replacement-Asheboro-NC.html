<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one reaction stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repetitive use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

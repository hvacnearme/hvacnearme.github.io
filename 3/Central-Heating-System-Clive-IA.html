<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can manage, a lot of Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a vicious, terrible summertime.<p>
<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Laconia NH 03246</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

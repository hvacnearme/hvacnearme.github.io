<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant direct exposure.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

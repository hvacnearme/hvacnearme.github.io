<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has been running for a while, consisting of people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales guy comes to your home he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>

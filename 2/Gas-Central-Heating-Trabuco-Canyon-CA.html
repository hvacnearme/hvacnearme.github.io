<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC specialists. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>

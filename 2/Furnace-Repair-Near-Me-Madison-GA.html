<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio.

<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this key in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple spaces at the same time, but are not really energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more money on cooling costs in the long run since of the lower energy performance.<p>

Therefore, this may not be the best option for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>

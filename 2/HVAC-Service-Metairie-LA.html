Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes damp.<p>

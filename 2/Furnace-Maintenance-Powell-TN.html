<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>

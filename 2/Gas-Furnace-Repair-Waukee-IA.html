<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

Rather than a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we might have more even heat. He consisted of these considerable but minor changes in his quote. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump due to the fact that of current warmer summers and for environmental factors.<p>
<p>Ac system can produce a great deal of water due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area.

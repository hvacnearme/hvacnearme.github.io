<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every 4 years. The Principles Handbook includes heating and cooling estimations. The style expert needs to consult ASHRAE data for the requirements of style and care as the normal building regulations provide little to no information on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful referral materials consist of items from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE ratings frequently come with greater cost.

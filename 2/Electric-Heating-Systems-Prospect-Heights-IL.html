<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

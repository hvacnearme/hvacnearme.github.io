<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>

Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.

Sending heat through solid objects will also cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A home heated up by a radiant system will warm up faster, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the many advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>

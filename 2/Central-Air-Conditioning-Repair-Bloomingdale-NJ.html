<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

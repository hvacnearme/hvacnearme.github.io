<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently.

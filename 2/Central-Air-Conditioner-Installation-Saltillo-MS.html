<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and ought to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>

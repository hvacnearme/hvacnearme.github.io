<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Fantastic AC Repair Company at Easton PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler generally occur when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is improperly lined up or used and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>

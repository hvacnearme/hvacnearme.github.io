<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

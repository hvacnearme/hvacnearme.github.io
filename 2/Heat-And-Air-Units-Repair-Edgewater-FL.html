<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

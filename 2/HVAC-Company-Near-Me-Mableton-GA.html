<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on rare events.<p>

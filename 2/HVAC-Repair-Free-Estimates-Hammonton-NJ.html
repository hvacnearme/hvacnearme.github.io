<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<p>Heat pumps are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that many Seattleites will just use sparingly, however because heat pumps can supply both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds! Not just are heat pumps convenient, they are extremely energy effective, too. If a heatpump remains in your future, the best time to set up cooling in your home may very well be when your heater breaks down.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>

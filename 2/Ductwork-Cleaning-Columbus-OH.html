<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological pollutants are damp or damp structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and badly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungi and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building residents.

<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Chester SC 29706</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater airflow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and new air purification technologies are becoming more typical as offered solutions in commercial and residential HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been prevalent, as clients stay mostly oblivious to the effects of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>

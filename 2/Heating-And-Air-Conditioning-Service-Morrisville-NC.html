<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

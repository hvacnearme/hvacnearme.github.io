Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

Seek Advice From the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Incentives for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax reductions readily available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating unit where you live.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time fixing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>

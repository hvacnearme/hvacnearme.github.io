<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion.

<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

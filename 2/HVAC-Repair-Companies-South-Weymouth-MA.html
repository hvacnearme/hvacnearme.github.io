<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.

These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency.

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
<p>Its special feature is the presence of one primary external system that linked to a number of indoor units.

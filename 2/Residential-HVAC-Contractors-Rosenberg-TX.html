<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

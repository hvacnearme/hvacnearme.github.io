This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate.

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

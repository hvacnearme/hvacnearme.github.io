Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, much of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

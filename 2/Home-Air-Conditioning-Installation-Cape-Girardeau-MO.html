<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Basically, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Cape Girardeau MO</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Do not panic! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply may need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage provided by your transformer to keep the digital screen on. You'll get a blank screen if 24 volts isn't obtained. There are many different reasons that your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be going over why you may be having problem with your Nest wise thermostat. Inspect your emergency breakers initially. You need to have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. Examine if you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace. In some cases the furnace switch is unintentionally turned off by someone increasing in the attic. There is a furnace switch that sometimes goes defective. It appears like a light switch in the attic. There are lots of wires in your furnace.<p>

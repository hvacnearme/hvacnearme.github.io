<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

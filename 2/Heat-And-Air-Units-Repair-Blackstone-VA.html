<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>

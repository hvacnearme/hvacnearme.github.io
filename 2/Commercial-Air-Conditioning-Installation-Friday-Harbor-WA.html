<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard ac system because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>

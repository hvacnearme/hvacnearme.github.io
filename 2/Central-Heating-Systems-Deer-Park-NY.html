The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

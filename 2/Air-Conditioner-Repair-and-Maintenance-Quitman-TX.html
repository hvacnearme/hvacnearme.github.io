<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>

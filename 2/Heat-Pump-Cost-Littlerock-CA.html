<h3>Choosing the Right Business For Heating and AC Systems at Littlerock CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

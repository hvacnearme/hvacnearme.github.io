<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Ebensburg PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

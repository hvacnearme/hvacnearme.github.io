<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>

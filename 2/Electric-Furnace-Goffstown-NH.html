They supply powerful air flow and are significantly more effective than basic wall systems and can, therefore, decrease the variety of units needed and this can decrease installation and or replacement expenses where numerous HVAC units are required. Ducted commercial-grade air conditioning systems are BETTER for the academic environment. They are generally the most expensive option; nevertheless, they are also the most visually pleasing as the duct-work and internal units hidden with minimal exposure.<p>

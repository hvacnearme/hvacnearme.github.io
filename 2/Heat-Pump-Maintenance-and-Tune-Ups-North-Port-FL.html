<p>Bear in mind that the SEER score is computed using the very same set of temperatures across the board. The typical summer temperature to reach the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to reach the appropriate SEER ranking for your location, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c systems manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a simple and reliable  method to minimize ambient air pollution and possible health threats, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services used. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a manufacturer's service warranty. Any significant repairs should be covered under the producer's warranty. However, some producers require regular maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>

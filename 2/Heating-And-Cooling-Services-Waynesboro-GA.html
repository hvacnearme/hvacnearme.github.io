<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

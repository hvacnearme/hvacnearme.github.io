HVAC professionals advise following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new.

Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

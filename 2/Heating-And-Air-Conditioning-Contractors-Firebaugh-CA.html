<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which usually consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of when a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated.

Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>

I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

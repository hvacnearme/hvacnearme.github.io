<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Often a short-lived indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more intricate issues-- determined by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the three methods listed below might be proper.<p>

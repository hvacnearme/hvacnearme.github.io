<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Altoona PA 16601</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years ago and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>

<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

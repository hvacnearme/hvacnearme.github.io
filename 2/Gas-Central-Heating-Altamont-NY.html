<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance gos to each year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other advantages. Some companies offer priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

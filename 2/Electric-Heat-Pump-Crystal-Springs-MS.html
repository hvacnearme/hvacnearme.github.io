<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.

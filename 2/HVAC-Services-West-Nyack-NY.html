<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants released by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high indoors may trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>

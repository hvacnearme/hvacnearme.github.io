The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>

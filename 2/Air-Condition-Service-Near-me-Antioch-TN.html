The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>

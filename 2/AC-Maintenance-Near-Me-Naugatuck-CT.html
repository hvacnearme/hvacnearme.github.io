<h3>HVAC Service in Naugatuck Connecticut</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats.

In this case, the control system is really important to keeping a proper temperature level.<p>

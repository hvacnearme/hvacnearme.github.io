<h3>Ductless AC System in Woodruff SC 29388</h3>
<p>Are you adding a brand-new room onto your home? Maybe you have a room with unique heating and cooling obstacles, such as rooms that always appear to be too hot or too cold.

<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location.

<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Hobbs NM</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely happy that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

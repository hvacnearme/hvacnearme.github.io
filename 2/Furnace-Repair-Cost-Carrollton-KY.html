Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that best temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined.

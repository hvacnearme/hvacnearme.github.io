<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically triggered by the lack of adequate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in majority the workplace indoor air investigations it has carried out.

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities.

The bright side is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>

<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Westbury NY</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

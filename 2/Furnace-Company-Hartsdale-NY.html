The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%.

Because an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

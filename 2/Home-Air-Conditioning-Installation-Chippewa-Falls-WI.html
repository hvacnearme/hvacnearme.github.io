Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable.

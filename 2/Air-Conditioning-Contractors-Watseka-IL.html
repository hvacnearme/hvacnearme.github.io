<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When setting up radiant heat, you need to provide severe idea to the type of floor covering in the house. Since it performs and shops heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, however work reasonably well. Carpets will straight insulate the flooring from the room, reducing effectiveness, so if you want to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with dense padding.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "regular" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to figure out if the basic indoor air quality meets a particular requirement.

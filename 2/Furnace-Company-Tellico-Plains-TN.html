<p>The compressor can shut and overheat down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Switch off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>

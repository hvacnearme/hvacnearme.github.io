<h3>Truth That You Might Not Know About a Boiler Heating System in Arcadia FL</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

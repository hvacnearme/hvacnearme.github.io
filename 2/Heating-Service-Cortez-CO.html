<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles.

Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>

The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is critical iin making sure the effectiveness and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in heaps. Generally, a 3-ton setup ought to suffice for the average home, however house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all aspects which will influence the right size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

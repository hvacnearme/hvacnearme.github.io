<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, merely including refrigerant is not a solution. A qualified technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your a/c is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be hazardous to the environment.<p>

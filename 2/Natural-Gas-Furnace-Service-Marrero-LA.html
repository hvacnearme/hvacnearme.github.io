<p>Lots of commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can likewise make use of natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outside air presented into an area per an unit of time, and is typically revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

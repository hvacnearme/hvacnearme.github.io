<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance benefit. Since they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since a system is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

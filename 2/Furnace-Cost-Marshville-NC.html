<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to call on these people two times. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, it's an organisation design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>

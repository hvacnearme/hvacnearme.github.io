<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

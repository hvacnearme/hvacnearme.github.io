<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Company in Pleasant Prairie WI 53158</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They showed up the next day and changed two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new furnaces can heat the house. Honestly, our home heating unit is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>

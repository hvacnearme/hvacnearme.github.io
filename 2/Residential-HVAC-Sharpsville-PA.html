<p>While pollutants frequently found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful impacts, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are necessary to produce particular health issue. Individuals also react extremely differently to direct exposure to indoor air pollutants. More research is required to better comprehend which health effects occur after exposure to the average toxin concentrations found in houses and which happen from the higher concentrations that happen for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>Because immunity differs significantly from specific to individual, it is not practical to develop a universal standard fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a 10 year study examining more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 ecological samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The building type included both residential and commercial. Most of samples evaluated were tested positive for germs and fungis.<p>

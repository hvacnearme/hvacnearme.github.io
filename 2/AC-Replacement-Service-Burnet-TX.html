Structures continuously progress as a result of the modifications in the environment around them along with the residents, materials, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a structure are continuously connecting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing somewhat over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned up, accumulates dirt once again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see may be evolving as an outcome of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
<p>For example, impurities may collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake lies near a source of wetness or other outside toxin, it might serve as a pathway to bring the contaminants inside.

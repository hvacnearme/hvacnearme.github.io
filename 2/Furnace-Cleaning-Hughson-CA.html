<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

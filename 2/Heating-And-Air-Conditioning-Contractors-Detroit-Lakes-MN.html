<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

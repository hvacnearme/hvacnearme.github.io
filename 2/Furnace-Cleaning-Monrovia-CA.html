<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>

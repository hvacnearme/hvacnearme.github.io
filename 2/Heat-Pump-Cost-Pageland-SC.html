My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>

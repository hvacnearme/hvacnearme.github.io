<p>Another impurity of indoor air is outside air. At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, people with asthma might discover being indoors uses the very best relief, if the indoor air environment is good. Although a/c does not filter the air, it assists individuals with asthma because doors and windows are kept shut, which helps keep pollens and other outside irritants and allergens out of the home. An abrupt shift in temperature level from warm to cold can also an asthma attack.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to figure out if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a certain requirement. Occupational exposure limits noted in health and safety regulations and the Limit Limit Worths ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent disease or particular impacts (like eye and nose inflammation) in industrial circumstances. These limitations might not be proper in workplace settings or for the home.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate.

The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>

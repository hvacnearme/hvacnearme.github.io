<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>

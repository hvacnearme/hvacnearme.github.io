<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

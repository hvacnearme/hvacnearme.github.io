<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Mohegan Lake New York</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>

Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2).

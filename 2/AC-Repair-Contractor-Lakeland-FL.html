<p>There is no easy response, however lots of use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better option.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>

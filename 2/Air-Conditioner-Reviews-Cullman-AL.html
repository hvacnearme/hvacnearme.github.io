<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

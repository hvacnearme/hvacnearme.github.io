<p>Though it might be difficult to think, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other contaminants that can not only filthy up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building materials contribute to poor air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>

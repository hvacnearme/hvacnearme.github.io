<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Prattville AL Home Owners</h3>
<p>Our team is led by the 2 Gamst siblings who both started working on air conditioners with their daddy John Gamst after school and on weekends. Whether it's servicing, repair, furnace, or air conditioning installation, neither one keeps in mind finding out the trade it simply came naturally. A structure like that and an enthusiasm to do the best thing is what makes our company what it is today. A Leading Technological HVAC thought leader and the only location to get a 5 year part service warranty with repairs.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>

<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal company. A carefully crafted business plan for an HVAC company is the primary step to manage those peaks and lulls so your earnings remain healthy year-round. If you didn't create a heating and cooling organisation strategy when you began your organisation, it's not far too late to build one now, or to offer your initial plan an update.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being blocked with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down completely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

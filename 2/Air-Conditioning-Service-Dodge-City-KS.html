Convected heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to circulate hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat moved heat to other articles in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything needs to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less efficient. Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps usually last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as twenty years.

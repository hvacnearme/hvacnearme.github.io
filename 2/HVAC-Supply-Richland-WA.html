<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

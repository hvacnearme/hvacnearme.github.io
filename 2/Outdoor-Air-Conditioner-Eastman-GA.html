<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should.

If the system is too little, then your home won't be heated sufficiently and the system will need to continuously run to attempt to heat the whole home, which will increase heating costs.<p>

Local building codes most likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that should be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation paired with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>

Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

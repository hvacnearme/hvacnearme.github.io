<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to set up, especially in an older home. Depending on the kind of system set up, it can be loud and trigger problems if you're highly allergic to dust. Furthermore, certain fuels and equipment may need special authorizations, and there is minimal flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause countless nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers nose, throat, and eye irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

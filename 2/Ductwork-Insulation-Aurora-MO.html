Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>5. Smell excellent naturally.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

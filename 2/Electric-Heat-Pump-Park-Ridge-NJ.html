<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel.

<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Park Ridge NJ 07656</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>

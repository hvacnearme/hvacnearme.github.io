He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up assessment results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>

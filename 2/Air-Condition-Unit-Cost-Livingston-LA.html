<p>These people have actually been great. At a real estate agent, I sometimes need contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a home might cost. Recently I needed to call on these people two times. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>

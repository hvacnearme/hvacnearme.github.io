Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

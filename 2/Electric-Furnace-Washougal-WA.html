<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Buildings are created or planned to respond actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and keep surface areas to enhance their durability, look, or performance. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or even dramatically alter buildings in ways that might be essential to their own integrity or their impact on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We might find it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the approaches utilized by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

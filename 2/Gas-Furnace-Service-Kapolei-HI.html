<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>

<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Easley SC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>

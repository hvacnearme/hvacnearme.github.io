<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>The heatpump gained appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from numerous sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air inside. Initially, heatpump HVAC systems were only utilized in moderate climates, but with enhancements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>
<p>Furthermore, house owners have a variety of alternatives to choose from in powering a floor heating system. Radiant systems are compatible with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As numerous property owners are all too mindful, legacy furnace systems are typically restricted to working on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the marketplace for that energy source turns volatile, rates can fluctuate, rates spike and you can wind up paying more to heat your house despite how low you set your thermostat.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>You should always employ an expert to conduct AC repair, for the exact same reason that you rely on a professional plumber or electrical expert.

A/c repair is no various. You constantly want to hire a professional to repair your system, so you can have the peace of mind associated relying on a professional in the field.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

The professionals who installed the new system were fast and expert, while taking time to make certain we comprehended how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Greenwood MS</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run continuously is since something is blocked or unclean Prior to trying to fix any problem, take some time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Examine the furnace blower for clogging and clean it if the air filter is excellent to go. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, contact an experienced technician.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

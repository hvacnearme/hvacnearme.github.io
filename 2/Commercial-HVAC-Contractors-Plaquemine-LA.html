<p>The function of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing safety at reasonable energy expenses. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J computation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square video footage alone, transfer to another contractor. As with measuring the size of a system required based upon BTUs, identifying the proper size of system for your home also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

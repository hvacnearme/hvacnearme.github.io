<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

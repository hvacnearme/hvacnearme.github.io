<p>Expert heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new.

<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<h3>HVAC Supply in Thomson Georgia</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>First of all, The after hours responding to service agent, John, was extremely polite and expert. Second Of All, Gracion W is a prompt, knowledgeable technician. He was at my home within the time he offered me, fixed the issue while describing the problem then remained a number of minutes to ensure it was working appropriately. The issue was repaired in a matter of time that I have actually never ever seen before while being a homeowner for ten years. I also suggest among the Security Strategies, which I am a member of, if you like to save money. Thank you." Karen P.<p>

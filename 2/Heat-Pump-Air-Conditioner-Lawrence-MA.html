<p>In basic, ductless AC units are more energy-efficient and environment-friendly than traditional Heating and coolings.

<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being filthy and old. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's performance. To make sure the system is working efficiently, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.

<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the unit. Loose, faulty or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes examining the advised connections as well as temperature and pressure evaluates. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and secure.<p>

Central air conditioning systems and heatpump generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement might be the most cost-efficient option.<p>

Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

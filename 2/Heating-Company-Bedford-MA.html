Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

Often times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability.

For that reason, this might not be the best option for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>

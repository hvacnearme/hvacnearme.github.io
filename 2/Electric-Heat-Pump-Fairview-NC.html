<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous.

<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>

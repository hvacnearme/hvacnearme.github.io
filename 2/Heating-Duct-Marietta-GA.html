<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will always be the odd problem that occasionally comes up. It is really crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible when you do see your furnace behaving oddly. The faster you respond to problems with your furnace, the simpler they are to fix. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the problem worse, and often more costly.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new construction (houses typically use in between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>

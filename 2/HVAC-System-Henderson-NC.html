<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size.

On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days.

<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the producer's directions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively adjusted.

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations build up inside.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in gathering details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>

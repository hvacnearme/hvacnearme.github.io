This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, and even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

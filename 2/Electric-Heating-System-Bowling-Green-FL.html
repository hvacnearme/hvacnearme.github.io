<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

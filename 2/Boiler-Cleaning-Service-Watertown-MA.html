Breathing air pollutants can result in allergic and asthmatic responses, infections and other health problems that involve the lungs, nose and throat. For instance, animal cats, caged birds and rodents, and pets can produce dander and other particles that can activate allergies or asthma signs in some individuals. Pre-owned smoke is also harmful to people, specifically kids.<p>

Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

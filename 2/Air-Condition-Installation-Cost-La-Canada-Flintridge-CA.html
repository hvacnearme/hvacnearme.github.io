<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. provided exceptional, tailored, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design gets along, reliable and interesting. He clearly and thoroughly explained all issues and repairs in a way that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my other half and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also responded to my call instantly the next morning, and coached me through a momentary fix to a problem that could not be solved on the first see due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's abilities, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>

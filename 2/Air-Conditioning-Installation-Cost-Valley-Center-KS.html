In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same.

If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>

<p>If your a/c unit is more than eight years of ages, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's a basic issue like debris obstructing the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to evaluate not just the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that provide the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those aspects might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing brand-new equipment.<p>

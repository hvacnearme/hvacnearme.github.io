<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really extensive in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided great customer support at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might want to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities.

After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

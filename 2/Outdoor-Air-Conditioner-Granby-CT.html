<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really extensive in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided great customer support at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might want to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heater, you may try to find a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the incredibly hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit.

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

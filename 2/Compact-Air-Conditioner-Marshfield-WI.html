<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand. Also, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to set up the air conditioning unit: Don't position it in an egress window that serves as the only means of escape should a fire erupt.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, particularly if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned and replaced routinely.

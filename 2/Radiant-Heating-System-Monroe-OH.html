<h3>Things to Search for When Hiring an Monroe OH HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I should say it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool down your home which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

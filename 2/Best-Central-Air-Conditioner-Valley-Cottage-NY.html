<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Valley Cottage NY</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

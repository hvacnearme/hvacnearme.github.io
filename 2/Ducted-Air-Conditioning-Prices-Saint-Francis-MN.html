<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

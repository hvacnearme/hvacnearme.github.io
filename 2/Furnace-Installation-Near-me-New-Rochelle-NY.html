<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types.

Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units.

<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>When installing radiant heat, you should provide major idea to the type of floor covering in the home. Since it performs and shops heat, ceramic tile works well.

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier.

No extra charge.<p>

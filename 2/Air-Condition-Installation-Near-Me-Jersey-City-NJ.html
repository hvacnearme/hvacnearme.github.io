<p>Great Product! Delivery was type of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we resolved issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Sean was very practical. He is a very pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

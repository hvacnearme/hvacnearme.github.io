A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several spaces with one external unit. In the outside system of this air conditioning system there is a more effective compressor, ports for linking numerous traces and automation with locking valves for controling the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor units found in the space.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

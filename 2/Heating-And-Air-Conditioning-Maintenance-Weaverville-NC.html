<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Weaverville NC</h3>
<p>Having a wood-burning heating system can be very effective in regards to cost. If you have access to free or inexpensive firewood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it may not cost you anything at all. Regrettably, wood-burning heater require an extremely essential natural resource: wood! Wood-burning heat systems might not be excellent for the environment in spite of being carbon neutral because of the amount of wood required to effectively heat your entire house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

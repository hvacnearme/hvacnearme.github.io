<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness.

If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use contracts.. The so called trusted companies swindle more individuals than the fly by night outfits. Due to the fact that I attempted to work for them, I know. Because 90% of them are criminals, I quit. They stroll in with or without an agreement and start offering you things you don't require.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>

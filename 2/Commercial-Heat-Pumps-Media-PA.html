<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To start, it's a great concept to consider energy performance. By selecting a central AC unit that has as high of a performance score as possible, you can minimize your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run. Efficiency ratings should be identified with all systems. While effective systems might cost more, going with an Energy Star-rated home appliance is an excellent method to enjoy extra peace of mind.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>

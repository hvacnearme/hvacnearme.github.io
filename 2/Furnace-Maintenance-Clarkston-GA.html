<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as medical facilities and high-rise buildings, cars such as cars, trains, submarines, aircrafts and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may discover moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your physician about them.

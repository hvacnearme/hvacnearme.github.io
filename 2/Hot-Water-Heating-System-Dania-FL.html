We can also provide tune-ups for your a/c unit or heating system to enhance efficiency and extend its beneficial life.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

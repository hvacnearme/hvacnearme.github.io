<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

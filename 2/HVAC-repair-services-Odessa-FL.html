<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this key in the backyards of homes. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple rooms at the same time, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more cash on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>

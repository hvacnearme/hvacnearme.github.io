However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>

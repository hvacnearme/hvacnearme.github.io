<p>Seattle furnaces can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the average temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected lifespan of 15 years. Your heater will work hard for you, but like your automobile, doing regular and regular maintenance will keep it running efficiently, avoid issues, and keep your warranty intact.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of a/c unit, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to understand and preserve.<p>

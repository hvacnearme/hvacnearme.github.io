The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for years, until the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production.

Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to purchase what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>Radiant heating offers a number of special advantages over forced air heating unit. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

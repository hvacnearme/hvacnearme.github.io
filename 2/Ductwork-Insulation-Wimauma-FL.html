<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>

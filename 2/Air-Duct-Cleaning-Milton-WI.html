<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>

<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and treat-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>

Taylor took adequate time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was excellent.

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

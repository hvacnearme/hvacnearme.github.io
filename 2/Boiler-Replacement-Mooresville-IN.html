<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>

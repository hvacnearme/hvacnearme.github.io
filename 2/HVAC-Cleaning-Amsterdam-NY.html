<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other offices is necessary not just for employees' convenience but also for their health.

All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>

In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>

Due to the fact that lots of illnesses can trigger these signs, detecting ill building syndrome is difficult.

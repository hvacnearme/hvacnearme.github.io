The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

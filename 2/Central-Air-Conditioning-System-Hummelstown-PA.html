<h3>The Way to Choose a Specialist HVAC Tech in Hummelstown PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

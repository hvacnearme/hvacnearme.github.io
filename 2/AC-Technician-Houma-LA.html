<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they should be positioned. Many frequently they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if people primarily stay seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensing unit accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are usually near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>

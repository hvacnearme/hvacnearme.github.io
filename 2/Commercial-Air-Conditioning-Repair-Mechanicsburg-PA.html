<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system occasionally.<p>

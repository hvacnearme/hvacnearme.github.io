The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation.

I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>

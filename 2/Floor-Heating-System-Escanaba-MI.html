<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not changing the entire part.

When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings develop inside, direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

They weren't low-cost however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part.

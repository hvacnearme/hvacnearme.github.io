<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating unit can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is very important to be aware of some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that might be lurking in your environments.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat irritant might cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>

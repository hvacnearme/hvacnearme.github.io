<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Rhinebeck NY - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>

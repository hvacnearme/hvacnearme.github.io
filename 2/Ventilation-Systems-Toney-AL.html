However, there are times when an easy maintenance call can determine a problem that will require a considerable investment to fix. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the pricey repair and enjoy continued convenience from your present heating unit? Or, do you make an even bigger monetary commitment to changing the furnace? The choice to replace or repair depends on you, and frequently it refers comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely offers greater energy efficiency and includes service warranty coverage.<p>

Local building codes likely define the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that should be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>

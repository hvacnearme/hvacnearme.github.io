<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Atlanta TX</h3>

Examine the furnace blower for blocking and clean it if the air filter is good to go. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, call a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>

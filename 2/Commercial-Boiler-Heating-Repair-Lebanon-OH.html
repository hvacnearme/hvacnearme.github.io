<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

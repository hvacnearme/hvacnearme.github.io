The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>

A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

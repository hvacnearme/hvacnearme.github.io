<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%.

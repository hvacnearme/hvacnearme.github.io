<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have multiple control panel. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>

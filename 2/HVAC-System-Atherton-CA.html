<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Atherton CA</h3>
<p>Convected heat systems are significantly popular, especially in the previous quarter-century as innovation has advanced, and the systems have actually proven themselves in dependability and economy. Unlike convection heating, radiant heat systems have no ductwork and no air circulation. Radiant systems depend on heat transfer by the infrared clinical concept used by the sun called line of vision." These undetectable electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a home, the warmer things naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is accomplished.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

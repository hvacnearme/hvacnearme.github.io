<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

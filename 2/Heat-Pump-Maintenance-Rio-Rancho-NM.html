<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians believed they simply didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

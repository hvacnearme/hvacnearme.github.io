<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have actually been properly dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Often a short-term indoor air quality issue is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated problems-- identified by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three methods below might be proper.<p>

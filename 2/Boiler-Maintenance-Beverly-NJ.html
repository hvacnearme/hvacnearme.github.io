<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>

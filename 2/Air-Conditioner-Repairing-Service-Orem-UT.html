<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors.

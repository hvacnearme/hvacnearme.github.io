Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>

<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment and huge residences. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, since the lack of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and wear.

<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of toxin exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Location control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents and even moving vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>Some health effects may appear soon after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are usually short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Not long after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some diseases such as asthma may show up, be exacerbated or worsened.<p>
<p>A radiator is the part of your vehicle that keeps the engine cool and protects it from extreme heating. To be cool, the radiator requires to remain tidy - constantly.

EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies additional info on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

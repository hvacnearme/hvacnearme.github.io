<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at reasonable energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Manual J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of a system required based upon BTUs, determining the proper size of unit for your house likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.

So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which usually includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>

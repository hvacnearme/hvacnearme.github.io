<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>

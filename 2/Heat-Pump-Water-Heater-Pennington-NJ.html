<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and shorten its life. Too small and your a/c unit won't have the ability to cool the house properly. These are just a few of the factors that you require to consider when purchasing a brand-new AC system. Each choice can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>

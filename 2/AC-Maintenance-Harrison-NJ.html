Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors.

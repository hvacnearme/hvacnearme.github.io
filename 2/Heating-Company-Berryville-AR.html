<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

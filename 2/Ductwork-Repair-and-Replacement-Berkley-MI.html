This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

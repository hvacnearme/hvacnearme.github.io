<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>

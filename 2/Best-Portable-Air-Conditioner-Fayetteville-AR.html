They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to purchase it. My better half stated that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall.

All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>

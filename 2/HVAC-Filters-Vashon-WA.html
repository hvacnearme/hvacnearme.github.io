This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

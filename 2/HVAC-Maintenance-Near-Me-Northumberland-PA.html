<p>Air pollutants can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where moisture levels are normally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

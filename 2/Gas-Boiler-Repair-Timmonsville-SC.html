<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally greater than lots of heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the model you buy.

This means it can heat up your home to the desired temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>By piping coolant directly into the smaller sized wall-mounted systems, ductless splits permit you to avoid the requirement for a complete duct system like many other cooling systems require.

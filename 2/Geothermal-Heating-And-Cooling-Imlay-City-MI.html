<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.

I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

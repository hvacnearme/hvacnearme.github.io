<p>We're spending a lot more time indoors, these days. While many people assume pollution is simply an outdoor problem, your house (and office) can also be polluted. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't believe sufficient about direct exposure to all the important things we position in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<p>Before cooling or installing any brand-new heating system in a home, it is required to re examine and lower the energy load of the house. A more energy efficient house will not just lower the cost of a new system and utility costs, but it will significantly improve the comfort of your home. Before we style and set up any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Standard enhancements usually include adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend numerous competent home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for references.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>

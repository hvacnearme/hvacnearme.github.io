These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0.

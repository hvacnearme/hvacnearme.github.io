<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

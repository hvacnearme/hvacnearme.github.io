<h3>Central Heat And Air Units in Oakland Maine</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC business owners do not understand they require different prices plans for different services that their company offers. For example, residential HVAC installation should be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service should be priced in a different way from duct cleaning. If you are using more than one service, you must separate these into various departments, as if they were their own different business.<p>

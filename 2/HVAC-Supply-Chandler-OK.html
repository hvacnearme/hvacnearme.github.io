<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Chandler OK Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Most people understand that outside air pollution can impact their health, but indoor air contamination can also have substantial, harmful impact. EPA research studies of human exposure to air contaminants indicate that indoor levels of pollutants may be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the leading 5 ecological health threats to the public.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface of a floor heats the lower half of the room, covering occupants in heat at a lower total temperature-- in many cases approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating system." To put it simply, in-floor heating unit provide a different mode and level of convenience. And, as different public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>

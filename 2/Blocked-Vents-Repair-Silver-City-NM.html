<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>

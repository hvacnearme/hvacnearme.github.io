<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from natural gas that leaves into your home without being burnt.

In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of when a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>

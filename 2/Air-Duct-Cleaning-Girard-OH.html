<p>. Prior to choosing the installation place of air conditioner, numerous main aspects require to be thought about. First off, the direction of air flow from the indoor units must not fall on the location of rest or work area.

The outdoor unit must likewise be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be successfully discharged outdoors and the efficiency of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is extremely a good idea to set up the air conditioning system units in easily accessible locations, for more maintenance throughout operation.<p>

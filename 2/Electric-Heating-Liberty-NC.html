<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources.

Stagnant air might likewise be an issue when ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area.<p>
<p>Even with the ideal system and proper installation, there's always the opportunity that your furnace will malfunction.

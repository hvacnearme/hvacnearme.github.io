<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Reading MA?</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>

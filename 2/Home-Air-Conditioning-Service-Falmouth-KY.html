<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

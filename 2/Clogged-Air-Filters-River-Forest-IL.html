Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install assessment outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality.

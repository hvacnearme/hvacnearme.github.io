Throughout the summer and winter, central air systems and heaters provide adequate cooling and heating power to homes in Redmond.

Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>

We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

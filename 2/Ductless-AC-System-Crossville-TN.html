<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

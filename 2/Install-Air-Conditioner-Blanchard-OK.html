<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Blanchard OK 73010</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>

<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are typically short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear right after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>

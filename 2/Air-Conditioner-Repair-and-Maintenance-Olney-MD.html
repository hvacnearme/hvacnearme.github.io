<p>Recent Review: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with options, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to replace the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it might be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>

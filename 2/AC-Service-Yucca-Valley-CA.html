<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>

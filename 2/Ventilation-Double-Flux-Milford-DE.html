Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

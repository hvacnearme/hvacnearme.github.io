<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems at Malibu CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not restricted to homes. In reality, numerous office buildings have significant air contamination sources Some of these buildings might be inadequately ventilated.

Finally, people normally have less control over the indoor environment in their workplaces than they carry out in their homes. As an outcome, there has been an increase in the occurrence of reported illness.<p>

Not only was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

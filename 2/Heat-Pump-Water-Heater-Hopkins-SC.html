<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as constructing products, home furnishings, and family items like air fresheners, release toxins basically continually. Other sources, related to activities carried out in the house, release toxins intermittently. These include smoking cigarettes, using unvented or malfunction-ing ranges, heating systems, or area heating units, making use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, using paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and using cleaning items and pesticides in house cleaning. High pollutant concentrations can remain in the air for extended periods after a few of these activities.<p>

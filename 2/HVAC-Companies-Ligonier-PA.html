The companies were not warned they were part of a research study, and the scientists did not control for time invested or methods utilized.

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends on private sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from procedures or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality problem is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complex issues-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, among the three tactics below may be proper.<p>

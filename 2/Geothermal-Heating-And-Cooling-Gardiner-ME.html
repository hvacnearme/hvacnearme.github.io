<h3>Ventilation System in Gardiner ME 04345</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

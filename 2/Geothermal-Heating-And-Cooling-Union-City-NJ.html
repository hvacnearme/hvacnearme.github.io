<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of workers in the location, stale air may likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>To be truthful, few of the facilities managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service came to us because of that. Usually they were initially thinking about remotely keeping track of some other aspect of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

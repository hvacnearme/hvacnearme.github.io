<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

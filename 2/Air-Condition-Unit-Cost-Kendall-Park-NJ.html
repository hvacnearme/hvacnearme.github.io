<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Westmont IL HVAC Company</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which requires to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely. Modification the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, decreasing their performance with time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>

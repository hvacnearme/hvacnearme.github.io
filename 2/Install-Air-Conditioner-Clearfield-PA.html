<h3>Electric Heating in Clearfield PA 16830</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your cooling system from flooding.

If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leak in the attic.

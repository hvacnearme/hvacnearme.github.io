<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in American Canyon CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>

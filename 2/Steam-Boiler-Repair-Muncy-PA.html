Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.

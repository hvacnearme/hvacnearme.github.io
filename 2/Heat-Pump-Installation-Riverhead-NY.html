<p>Not all sensing units work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software application.

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

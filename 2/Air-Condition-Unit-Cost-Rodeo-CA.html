<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working, integrity Energy was fast to respond. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new furnaces can heat the house. Honestly, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>

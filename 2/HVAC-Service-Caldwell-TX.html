<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

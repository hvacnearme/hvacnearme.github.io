<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.

As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

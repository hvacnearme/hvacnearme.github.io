<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have been properly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

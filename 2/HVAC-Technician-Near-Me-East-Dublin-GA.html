<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>

<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's probably your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter needs changing. The easiest way to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

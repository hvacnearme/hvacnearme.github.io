<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

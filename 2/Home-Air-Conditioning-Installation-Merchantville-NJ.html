<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

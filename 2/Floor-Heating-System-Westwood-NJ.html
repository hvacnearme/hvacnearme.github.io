<p>There is no simple answer, however lots of use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a better solution.

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost.

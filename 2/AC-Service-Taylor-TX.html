<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>

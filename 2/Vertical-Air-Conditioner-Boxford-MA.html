<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in numerous thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

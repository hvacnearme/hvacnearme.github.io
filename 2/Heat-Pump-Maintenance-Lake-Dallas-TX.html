Some sources, such as developing products, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch contaminants basically continuously. Other sources, related to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies launch toxins periodically. Malfunctioning or unvented devices or incorrectly utilized products can launch higher and in some cases dangerous levels of pollutants inside your home.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not heat up.

An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

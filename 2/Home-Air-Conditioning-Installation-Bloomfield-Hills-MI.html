Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are lastly giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

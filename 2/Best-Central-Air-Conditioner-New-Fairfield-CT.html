<p>As with most home improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating system can vary commonly based on the size of the house. Many furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner need to consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too quickly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>

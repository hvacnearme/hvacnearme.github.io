<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, including polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers.

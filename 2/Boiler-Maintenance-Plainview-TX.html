<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

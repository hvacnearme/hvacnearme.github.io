The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>

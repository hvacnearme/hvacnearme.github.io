Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely thankful to have a heated home once again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right prior to a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

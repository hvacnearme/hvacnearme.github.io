<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by a lot of public water supplies, it has actually been discovered in well water. If you've evaluated the air in your home and found a radon issue, and you have a well, call a lab licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, because some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>

Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimum efficiency and could get too hot.

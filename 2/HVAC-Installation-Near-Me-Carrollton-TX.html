<p>You must constantly work with a professional to perform AC repair, for the exact same reason that you trust a professional plumbing technician or electrician. You don't conduct repairs on your own plumbing system, or change your own electrical grid. The reasons that you don't do those things are apparent. You do not have the tools, or the knowledge, to be sure that you conduct those treatments securely and properly. Experts, nevertheless, do have the tools and expertise to do the task correctly.

This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>

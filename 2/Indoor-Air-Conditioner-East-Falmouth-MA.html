<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in East Falmouth MA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter season can exacerbate issues.

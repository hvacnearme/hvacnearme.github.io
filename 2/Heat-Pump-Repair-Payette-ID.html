<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the site of their initial application, it is sensible to decrease the use of chemical pesticides outdoors along with inside. Depending upon the site and pest to be managed, one or more of the following steps can be effective: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and family pets. Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by making sure that wooden building products do not enter into direct contact with the soil and by keeping fire wood away from the home. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be significantly minimized.<p>

<p>Equipment costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency models will cost less, but result in higher energy costs. High-efficiency models cost more, but save more over the long haul. Costs for gas heating systems range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric heating systems start at $395 and vary as much as $1,700 or more depending on the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Often a short-lived indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more intricate issues-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 strategies listed below may be suitable.<p>

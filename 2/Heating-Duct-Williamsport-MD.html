<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

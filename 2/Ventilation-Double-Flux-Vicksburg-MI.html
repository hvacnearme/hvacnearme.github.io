The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future.

Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

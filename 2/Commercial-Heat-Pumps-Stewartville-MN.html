<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>

Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

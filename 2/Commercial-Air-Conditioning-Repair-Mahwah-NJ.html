A ductless system has a built-in effectiveness benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

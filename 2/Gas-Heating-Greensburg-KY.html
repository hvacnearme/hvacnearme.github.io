<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping maker to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other articles in the rooms, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

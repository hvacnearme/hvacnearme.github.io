<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, as opposed to commercial or outside settings. For example, promoting maintenance services to existing customers throughout the slow season can help relieve the peak season stress on your tech team, as noted in A/c, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Technicians can primarily focus on responding to calls from brand-new customers, while your developed clients remain pleased as their HVAC systems hum along perfectly thanks to proactive checkups.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>As a structure owner or facility supervisor, you need to think about the cost of unanticipated downtime and the impact older, inefficient systems have on the bottom line. Running your existing devices to failure will involve ever-increasing service expenses, in addition to the anxiety of unanticipated system interruptions.

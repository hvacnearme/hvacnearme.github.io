We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks.

<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, a professional service person must be called for almost any maintenance other than routine cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners must be professionally inspected and adjusted prior to the beginning of every cooling season. Nevertheless, don't let your maintenance end with this annual examination. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak efficiency.<p>

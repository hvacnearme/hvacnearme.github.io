<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is frosty. Also, if the air conditioning unit smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Donna TX 78537</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

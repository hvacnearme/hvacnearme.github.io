<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may observe musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>

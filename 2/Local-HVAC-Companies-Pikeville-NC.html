A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Installed cost shows the most typical average installed cost across the USA for a 3 Heap unit. Rate might differ in your area.

Any modifications or modifications to Standard Installation concurred upon by Buyer will be an additional cost as worked out by Buyer and the independent Trane Comfort Specialist including the cost of mechanical authorizations that might be required by local and state law. Price ranges do not include any taxes, now or hereafter enacted. Taxes will be added by your Trane Comfort Expert to the sales price to adhere to local and federal tax law.<p>

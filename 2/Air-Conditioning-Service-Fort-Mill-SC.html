<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

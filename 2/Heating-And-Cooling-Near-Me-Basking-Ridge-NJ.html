From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants streaming through your system. They can likewise keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

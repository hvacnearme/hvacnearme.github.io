<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

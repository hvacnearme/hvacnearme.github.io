<p>The exhaust outlets permit all unsafe gases to leave your home so there's no risky buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can result in a harmful build-up and jeopardize your safety.

They will search for indications of deterioration, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>

Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

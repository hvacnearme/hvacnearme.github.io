They will search for indications of deterioration, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>

Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

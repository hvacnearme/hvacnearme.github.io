Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>

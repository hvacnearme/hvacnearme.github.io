This is normally utilized in a third-floor or second location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>

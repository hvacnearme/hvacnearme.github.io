<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Morrow OH</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future.

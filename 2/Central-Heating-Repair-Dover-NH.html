<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Dover NH - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in home construction is to reduce air leak through fractures and other openings in floorings, roofings, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

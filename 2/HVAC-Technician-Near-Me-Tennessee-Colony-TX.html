<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. Often there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>

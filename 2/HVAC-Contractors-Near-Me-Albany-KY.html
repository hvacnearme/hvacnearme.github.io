<h3>Benefits Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Albany KY</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in leading condition for the a/c to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the home. If the individual parts are in correct order, the technician can take a look at the ductwork for signs of holes, gaps or excessive dirt. Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

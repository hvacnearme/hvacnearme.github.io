<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the system has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

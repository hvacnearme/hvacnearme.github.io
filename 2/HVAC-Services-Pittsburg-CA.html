<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in surprise or seldom accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the location using established health department recommendations.<p>

<p>The world's leading all-in-one software for commercial and residential HVAC businesses. HVAC professionals are subject to a variety of potentially hazardous conditions. Service technicians are often needed to operate in cramped areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofing systems of homes. They can be exposed to unfavorable weather for long periods of time. Considering that they are called to structures without working environment control, they are also subject to the severe hot or cold temperature levels existing inside a location.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can end up being blocked with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down totally. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work effectively in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical energy, a heat pump is an affordable option using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like an area heating system) with the very same quantity of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of workers in the location, stagnant air may also be an issue.<p>

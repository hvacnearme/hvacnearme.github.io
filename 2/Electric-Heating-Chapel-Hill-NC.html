<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Chapel Hill NC</h3>
<p>Most people are aware that outside air contamination can impact their health, however indoor air contamination can also have substantial, hazardous effect. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants suggest that indoor levels of pollutants may be 2 to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the top five environmental health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

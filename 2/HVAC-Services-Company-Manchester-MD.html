<p>While pollutant levels from private sources may not present a substantial health threat on their own, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative results of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that many people can take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to assist you choose whether to take actions that can decrease the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>Trane central air conditioning conditioners are known for supporting guarantees and provides a standard 10-year warranty that covers both parts and labor. A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER rating in energy performance would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to set up.

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>

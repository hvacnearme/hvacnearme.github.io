<p>If your ac system is more than eight years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's an easy problem like particles blocking the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to evaluate not simply the condition of your existing devices, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those components might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing new machinery.<p>

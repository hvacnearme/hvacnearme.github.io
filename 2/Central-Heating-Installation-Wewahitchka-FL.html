<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95).

(He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>

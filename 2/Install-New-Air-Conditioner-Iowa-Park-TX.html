<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

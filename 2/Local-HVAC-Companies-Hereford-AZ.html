<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>My eldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>

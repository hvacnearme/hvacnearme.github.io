The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings.

<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may end up being blocked, decreasing air circulation volume, quality, and circulation.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be properly kept to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

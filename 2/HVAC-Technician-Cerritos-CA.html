Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Professional heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this standard guideline when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Because they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because a system is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

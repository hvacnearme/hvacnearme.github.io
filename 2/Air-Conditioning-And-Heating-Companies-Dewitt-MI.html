<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Dewitt MI</h3>

Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air distributing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

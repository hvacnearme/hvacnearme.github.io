According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

A building walk-through to look for smells and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings may be useful. Leakages need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can become contaminated with germs or fungis and need to be removed, also.

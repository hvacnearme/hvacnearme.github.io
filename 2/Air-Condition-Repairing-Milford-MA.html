<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>

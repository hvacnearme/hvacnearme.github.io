A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>

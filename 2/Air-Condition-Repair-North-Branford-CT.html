<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

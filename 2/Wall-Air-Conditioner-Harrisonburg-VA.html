<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

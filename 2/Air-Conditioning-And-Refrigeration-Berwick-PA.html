<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

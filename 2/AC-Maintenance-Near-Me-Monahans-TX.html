<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Monahans TX</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in home building and construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofs, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>

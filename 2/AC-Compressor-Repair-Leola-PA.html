<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large seller who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in stores to save money on costs (especially at night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an appropriate range that could avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but lots of use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better option.

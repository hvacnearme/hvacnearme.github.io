<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Gilbertsville PA 19525</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

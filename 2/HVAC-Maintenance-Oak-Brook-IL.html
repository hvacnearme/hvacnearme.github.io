<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

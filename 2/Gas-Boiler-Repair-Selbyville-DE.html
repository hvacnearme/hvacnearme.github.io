<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>

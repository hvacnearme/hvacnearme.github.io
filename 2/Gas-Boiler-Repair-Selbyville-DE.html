<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your home, however there are numerous other pollutants that can not just filthy up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building products add to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers.

Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>

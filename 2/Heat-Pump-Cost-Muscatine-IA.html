<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>

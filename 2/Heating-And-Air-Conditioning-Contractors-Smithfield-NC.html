<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers exposure to pollutants during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, frequently shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a new gas range or variety, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never utilize a gas range to heat your house. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working.

<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Oroville CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Message or call technicians to ask whether they can carry out a consultation over the phone or even over a video call.

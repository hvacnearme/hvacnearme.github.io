<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may see undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>

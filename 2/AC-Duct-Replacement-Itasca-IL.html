<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>

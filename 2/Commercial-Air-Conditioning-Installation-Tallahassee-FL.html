<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large company in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>

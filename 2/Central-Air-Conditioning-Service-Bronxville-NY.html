<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Bronxville NY?</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is necessary to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leaks, the system should be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems need to be inspected a minimum of two times annually for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>

<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was kind of unusual being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we resolved problems. I would recommend this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>It is not recommended that "routine" occupational exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the general indoor air quality meets a specific requirement. Occupational exposure limits noted in health and safety regulations and the Threshold Limit Values ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to avoid disease or particular impacts (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial circumstances. These limitations might not be suitable in workplace settings or for the house.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>My eldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>

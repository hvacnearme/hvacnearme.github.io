<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

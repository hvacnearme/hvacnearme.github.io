<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short cycling in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. Often, the furnace will just run more difficult to preserve a warm climate for your house when the weather is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our technicians if you require clarity on this issue.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better option. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>

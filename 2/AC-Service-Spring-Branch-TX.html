<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>

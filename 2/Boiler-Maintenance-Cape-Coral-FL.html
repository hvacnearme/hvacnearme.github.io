<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your automobile. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

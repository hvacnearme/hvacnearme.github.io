<p>. Before selecting the installation place of ac system, several main aspects need to be considered. First off, the direction of air flow from the indoor units ought to not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there need to not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the space of the properties as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently discharged outside and the performance of the whole system will drop greatly. It is highly advisable to set up the air conditioner systems in easily available locations, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>Many AC systems come with a number of unique features that can further improve performance and effectiveness. For instance, house owners may wish to look for one that includes a built-in filter light that will signal you when the air filter requires to be changed.

A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must likewise be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, homeowners must look out to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization procedures should not be undertaken until these issues have actually been remedied.<p>

<p>Many AC units feature a number of special functions that can even more improve performance and performance. For instance, homeowners might want to search for one that includes an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed.

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for house owners to think about.

Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

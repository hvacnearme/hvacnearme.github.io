<p>Due to the fact that these activities create large amounts of lead dust, people have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or real estate department for suggestions on which public companies or private laboratories may be able to help evaluate your house for lead in paint. Home test sets can not identify small amounts of lead under some conditions. Hire an individual with unique training for correcting lead paint issues to remove lead-based paint.

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Inverness FL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual events.<p>

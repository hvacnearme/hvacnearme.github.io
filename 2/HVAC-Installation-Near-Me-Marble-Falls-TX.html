<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>

<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a straightforward and efficient  approach to decrease ambient air contamination and possible health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

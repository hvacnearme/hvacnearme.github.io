<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this.

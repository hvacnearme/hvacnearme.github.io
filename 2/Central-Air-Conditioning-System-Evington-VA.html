Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>

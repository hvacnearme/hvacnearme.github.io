<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become obstructed with particles that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can generally be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
<p>Many AC systems feature a variety of special functions that can even more enhance efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, homeowners may want to look for one that features an integrated filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to minimize energy expenses much more. Obviously, more features imply greater central air expenses.<p>

<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Companies in Little River</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

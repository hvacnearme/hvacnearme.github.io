<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

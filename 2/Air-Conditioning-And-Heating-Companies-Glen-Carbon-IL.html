<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heaters can heat the house.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be better to replace the entire system.<p>

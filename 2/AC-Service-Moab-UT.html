<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

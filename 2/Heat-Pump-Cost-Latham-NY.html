I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

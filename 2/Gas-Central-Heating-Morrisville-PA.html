You can usually conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Morrisville PA</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the home. If the specific parts remain in correct order, the technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or extreme dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summer.<p>

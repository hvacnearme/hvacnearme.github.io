<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue.

I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>

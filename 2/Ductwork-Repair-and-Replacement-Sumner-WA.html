<p>All Points Heating offers home a/c, a/c installation, a/c maintenance that provide reputable, proven efficiency at high effectiveness. Combustion items from car exhaust, heating systems, water heaters, area heaters, fragrant candles, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not effectively vented can produce carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items may lead to eye, nose, and throat irritation; tiredness; lightheadedness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

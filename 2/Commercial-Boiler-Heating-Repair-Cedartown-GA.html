<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is determined utilizing the very same set of temperatures throughout the board. The average summer season temperature to get to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to come to the proper SEER score for your location, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c units manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>Ac system service consultations cover a long list of checks in, on and around your devices. Oak Grove Heating & Cooling specialists will take a look at things that might be making your system work inefficiently, such as refrigerant charge.

<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>Start by reading the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Many units come with a package that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will ensure a safe and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for additional support, specifically for larger air conditioning system, consider acquiring a steel support bracket and mount it to the outdoors home wall, straight listed below the windowsill.<p>

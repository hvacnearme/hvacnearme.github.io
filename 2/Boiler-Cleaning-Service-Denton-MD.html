<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>The most common kind of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive choice, however more recent systems can be very energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly effective gas furnaces can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>

This can lead to the potential for significant illness.<p>

Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

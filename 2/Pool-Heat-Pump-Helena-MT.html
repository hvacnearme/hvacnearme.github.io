<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Helena Montana</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>

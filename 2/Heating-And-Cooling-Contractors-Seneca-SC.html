<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Seneca SC</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of scientific proof has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously contaminated than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that people spend roughly 90 percent of their time indoors. Therefore, for many individuals, the dangers to health may be greater due to exposure to air contamination indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler typically happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is poorly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>

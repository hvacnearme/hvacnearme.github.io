From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>We advise using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by serving as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes.

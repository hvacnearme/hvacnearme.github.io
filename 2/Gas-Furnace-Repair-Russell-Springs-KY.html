<h3>Things Every Homeowner Knows About Hiring Russell Springs KY HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>

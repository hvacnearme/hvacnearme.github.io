<p>The purpose of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at reasonable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Manual J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video footage alone. Similar to determining the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of system for your home also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

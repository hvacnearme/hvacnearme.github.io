<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. There are several style approaches in usage today; nevertheless, all ground source heatpump operate with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

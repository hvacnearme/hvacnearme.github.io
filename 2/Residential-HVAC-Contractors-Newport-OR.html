<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at house over the weekend. Area control involves moving the toxin source away from residents or even moving vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heaters While oil is traditionally utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the exact same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

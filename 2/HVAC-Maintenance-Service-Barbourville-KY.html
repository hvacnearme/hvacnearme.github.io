<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The technological developments in heating equipment have actually been improving year after year. Boilers and heating systems now use less fuel to provide heat and warm water, are a lot easier to maintain, and are also smaller sized and quieter.

While remarkable in many aspects, newer equipment still requires to be correctly maintained to provide ongoing, safe operation at peak effectiveness.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

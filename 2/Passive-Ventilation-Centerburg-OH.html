<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness in time. Anticipate to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>

<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

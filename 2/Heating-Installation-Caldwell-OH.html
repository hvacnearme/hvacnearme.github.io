<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem.

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>

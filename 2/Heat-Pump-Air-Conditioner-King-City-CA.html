<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

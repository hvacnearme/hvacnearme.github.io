<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a referral later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

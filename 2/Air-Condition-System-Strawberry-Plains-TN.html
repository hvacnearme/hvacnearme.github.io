(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>

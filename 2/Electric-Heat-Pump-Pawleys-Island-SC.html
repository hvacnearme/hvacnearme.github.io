<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up.

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Rowlett TX</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being far more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a business or merchant to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system. A voided service warranty will not do you any good ought to the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and hire a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>

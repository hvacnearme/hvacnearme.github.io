<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

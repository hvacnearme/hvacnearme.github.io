<p>Aspects that can add to the growth of biological impurities are wet or damp building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.

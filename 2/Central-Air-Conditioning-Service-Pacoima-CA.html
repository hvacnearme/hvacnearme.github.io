<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

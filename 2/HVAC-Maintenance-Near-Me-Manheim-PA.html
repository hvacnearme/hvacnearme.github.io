<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

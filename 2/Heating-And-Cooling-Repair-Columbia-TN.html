<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 on average. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your house, and if it develops cracks which leakage, they need to be repaired. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with worse outcomes. Your house will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy costs will go up. Setting up brand-new ductwork for the entire home will cost approximately in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but many utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better solution. If the present system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be identified and corrected, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>

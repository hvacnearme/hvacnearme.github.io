<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently vital to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can in some cases be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information might determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>

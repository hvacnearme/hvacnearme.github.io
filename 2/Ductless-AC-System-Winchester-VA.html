Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.

<p>We suggest utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as a really efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be successfully determined or remedied without a comprehensive structure investigation.

<p>Filters can get filthy easily, especially if you live in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned up and replaced regularly.

<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>

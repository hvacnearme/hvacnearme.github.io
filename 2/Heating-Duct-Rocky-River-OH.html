<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

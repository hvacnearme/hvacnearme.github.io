<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Hammond IN?</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various house performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's products and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the required electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the entire surface area of a floor heats the lower half of the space, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower total temperature-- in many cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heater." In other words, in-floor heater supply a different mode and level of convenience. And, as different public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfy we feel, the more likely we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>

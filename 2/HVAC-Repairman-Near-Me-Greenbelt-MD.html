<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but many utilize the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better service. If the existing system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants.

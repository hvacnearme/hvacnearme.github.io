<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While room cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>

<h3>Things to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Lamar MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

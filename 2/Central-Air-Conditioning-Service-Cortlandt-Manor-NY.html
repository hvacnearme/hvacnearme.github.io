<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>

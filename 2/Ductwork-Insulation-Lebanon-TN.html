<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, considering that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

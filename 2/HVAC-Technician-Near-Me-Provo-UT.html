<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and germs, pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>

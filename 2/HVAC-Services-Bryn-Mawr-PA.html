<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time.

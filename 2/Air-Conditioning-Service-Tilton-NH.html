<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electricity, a heatpump is a cost-effective option utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air currently inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated performance advantage. Because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since a system is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

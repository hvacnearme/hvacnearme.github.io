<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

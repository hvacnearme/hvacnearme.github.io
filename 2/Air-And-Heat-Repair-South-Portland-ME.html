<p>Although installation is simple and doesn't require much time, attempting this job is not a good concept.

Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly).

Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the task; some developed illness from exposure to clothes and equipment brought home from task websites.<p>

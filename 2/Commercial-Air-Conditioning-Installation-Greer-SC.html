<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>

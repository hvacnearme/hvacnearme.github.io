<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>

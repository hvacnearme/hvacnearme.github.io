Numerous typical structure products utilized before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Typically, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling.

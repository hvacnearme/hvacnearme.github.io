<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Southbury Connecticut</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold enjoy wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other irritants under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioner during summer months) helps in reducing wetness in indoor air and successfully controls allergens, Lang states. An air conditioning system also reduces indoor pollen count - another plus for allergic reaction -patients.<p>
<p>Gas heating systems do feature some downsides. The biggest disadvantage is likewise the result of the combustion procedure. This process emits exhaust gases, consisting of carbon monoxide gas, which have to be vented to the outside of the house.

It is incredibly important to have your gas furnace frequently serviced, and to make certain your home has a carbon monoxide gas alarm installed.<p>

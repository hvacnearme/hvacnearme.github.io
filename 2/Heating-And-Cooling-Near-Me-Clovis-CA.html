Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>

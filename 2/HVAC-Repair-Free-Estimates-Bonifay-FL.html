<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

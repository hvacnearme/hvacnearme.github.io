Load computing is referred to as the Manual J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video alone. Just like determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, identifying the right size of unit for your house also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

In the outside unit of this a/c there is a more effective compressor, ports for linking numerous traces and automation with locking valves for controling the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor units located in the space.<p>
<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Enhance your services, earn more services earnings, and provide an incredible consumer experience. To make sure the unit you pick is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load estimation estimate to determine the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply replace it with the same size unit you currently have.

<p>A SEER ranking represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same period. Essentially, SEER provides more data based on how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>

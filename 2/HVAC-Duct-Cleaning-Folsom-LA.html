<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue.

Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up not long after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>

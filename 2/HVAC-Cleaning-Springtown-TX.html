The task of an HVAC technician is fairly complicated and can vary substantially from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job might require completely various actions and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being inspected. Installations can also vary considerably, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can become obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can generally be carried out in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with your home.

These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

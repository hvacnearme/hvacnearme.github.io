<h3>Heat Ventilation in Kingston NY 12401</h3>
<p>Customer products which contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to cause cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms related to direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas. Carefully read the labels consisting of health risk information and warns on the appropriate usage of these items. Use items which contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; usage inside just if the area is well ventilated.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts might show up after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are generally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear right after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house might not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or stinky air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To find odors in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>

<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the greater temperatures in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal convenience inside.

Temporarily increasing ventilation coupled with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and moisture indoors is related to a higher occurrence of resident breathing problems.<p>

I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger.

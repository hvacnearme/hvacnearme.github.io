<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

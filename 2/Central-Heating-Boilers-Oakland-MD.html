It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heating system can likewise be connected to a device called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heat pump compressor and uses it to heat water.

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

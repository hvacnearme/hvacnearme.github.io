<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

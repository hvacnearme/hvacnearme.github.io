Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family house installation business completely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many people.<p>

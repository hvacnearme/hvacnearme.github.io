<h3>Residential HVAC in Old Lyme CT 06371</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>The bureau projects 34 percent work development for HVAC service technicians between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all professions.

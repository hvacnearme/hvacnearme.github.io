<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally higher than numerous heatpump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the design you buy.

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical power. The 2 operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>

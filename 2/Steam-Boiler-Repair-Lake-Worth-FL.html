<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has become an essential concern to house owners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution studies have identified several contaminants that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion products, unpredictable natural compounds (consisting of formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are necessary in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Since approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage. Ductless heatpump are terrific for additions since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

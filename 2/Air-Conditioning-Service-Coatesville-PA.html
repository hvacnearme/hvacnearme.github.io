<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, because the system is combined.

Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>

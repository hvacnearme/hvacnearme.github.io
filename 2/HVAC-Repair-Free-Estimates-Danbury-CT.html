<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

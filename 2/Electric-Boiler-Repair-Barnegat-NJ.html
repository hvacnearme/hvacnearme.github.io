<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

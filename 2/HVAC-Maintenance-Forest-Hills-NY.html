They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to buy it. My wife said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have met in a long period of time.

<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

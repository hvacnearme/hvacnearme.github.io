Air supply and return ducts come from inside through the house's outside wall or roofing to connect with the packaged air conditioning unit, which is generally located outdoors. Packaged ac system frequently include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This combination of air conditioner and central heating unit removes the need for a different furnace inside.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>Filters can get unclean easily, especially if you live in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed routinely, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to. The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will intensify. Examining and changing the air filters is one of the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>

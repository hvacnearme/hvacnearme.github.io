What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

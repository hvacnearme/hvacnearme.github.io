<h3>How to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing in Denham Springs LA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

The controlled temperature and humidity helped keep consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was used to increase performance in the work environment, and The Carrier Cooling Company of America was formed to fulfill increasing demand. With time, air conditioning happened used to enhance comfort in homes and automobiles too.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Chickamauga GA 30707</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

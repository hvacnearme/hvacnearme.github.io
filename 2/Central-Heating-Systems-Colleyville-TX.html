<p>Aspects that can contribute to the growth of biological contaminants are wet or damp structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and household plants.<p>

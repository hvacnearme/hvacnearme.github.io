HVAC professionals advise following this standard guideline when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

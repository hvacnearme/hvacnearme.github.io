<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.

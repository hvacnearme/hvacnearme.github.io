They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My wife said that she had actually seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall.

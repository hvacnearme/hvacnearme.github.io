<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Do not just toss these undesirable products in the trash bin. Find out if your local government or any company in your neighborhood sponsors big days for the collection of harmful home wastes. If such days are readily available, utilize them to deal with the undesirable containers safely. If no such collection days are available, think about arranging one.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Direct exposure Evaluation Methodology (TEAM) research studies found levels of about a dozen typical organic contaminants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside houses than outside, no matter whether the homes were found in rural or highly commercial locations. Additional GROUP research studies indicate that while individuals are utilizing products including natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to really high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is completed.<p>

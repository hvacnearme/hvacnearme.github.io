<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps need to likewise be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents need to be alert to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps must not be carried out till these problems have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the result of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and insufficient or excessive air circulation.

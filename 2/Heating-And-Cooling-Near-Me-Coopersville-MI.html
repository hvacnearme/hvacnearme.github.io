<h3>AC Replacement Service in Coopersville MI 49404</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

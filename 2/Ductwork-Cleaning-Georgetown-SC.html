<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Georgetown SC</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

Electrical power producing companies top the list, with a typical wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 annually.

<p>Particular instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically hard to determine if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is essential to take notice of the time and place the signs take place. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Terrific Item! Delivery was sort of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

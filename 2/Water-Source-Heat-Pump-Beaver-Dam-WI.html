<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Beaver Dam WI</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

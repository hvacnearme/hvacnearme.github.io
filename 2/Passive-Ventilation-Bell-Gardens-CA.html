<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place.

For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in holes and cracks. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>

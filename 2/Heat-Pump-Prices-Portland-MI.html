<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

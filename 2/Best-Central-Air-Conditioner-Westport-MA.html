<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

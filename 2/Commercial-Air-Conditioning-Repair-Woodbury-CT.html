<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Woodbury CT HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was type of weird being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved problems. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years ago and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>The early couple of years of your organisation are an exciting time, and it's appealing to let pure enthusiasm direct your path forward.

And bear in mind that an organisation prepare for an HVAC company isn't implied to be a static file. It's a structure to revamp or guide the launch of your company that you can build on and restructure as business progresses.<p>

<p>Both must be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

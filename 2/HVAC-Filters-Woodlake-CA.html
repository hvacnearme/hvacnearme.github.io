Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.

They fulfilled my needs entirely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants.

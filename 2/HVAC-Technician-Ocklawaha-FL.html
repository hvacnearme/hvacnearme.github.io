<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

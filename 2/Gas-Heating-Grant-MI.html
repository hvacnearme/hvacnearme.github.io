<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

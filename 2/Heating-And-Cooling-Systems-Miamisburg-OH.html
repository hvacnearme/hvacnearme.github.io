<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Miamisburg OH 45342</h3>
<p>Last week, Target told reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a 3rd party vendor. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in concern was a heating, air and refrigeration  conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a variety of locations at Target and other leading sellers.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the problem and repaired really rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The primary reason property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services offered. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a producer's guarantee. Any major repairs need to be covered under the maker's service warranty. However, some manufacturers need routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>

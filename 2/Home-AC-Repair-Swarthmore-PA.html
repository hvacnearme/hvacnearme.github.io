<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

The different surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly connecting, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing slightly in time as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned up, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see may be developing as an outcome of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>

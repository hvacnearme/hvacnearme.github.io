<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from a business or seller to do the installation. If you choose to try to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided guarantee won't do you any good should the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and hire a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>

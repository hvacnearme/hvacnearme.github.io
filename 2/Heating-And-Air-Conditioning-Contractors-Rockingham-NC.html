<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Rockingham NC</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

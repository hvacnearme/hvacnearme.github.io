<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will reduce the unit's efficiency.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>

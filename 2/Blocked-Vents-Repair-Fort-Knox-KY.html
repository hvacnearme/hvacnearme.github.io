I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, because the unit is combined.

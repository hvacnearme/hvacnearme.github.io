<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and houses matters, particularly since we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>

Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Provider.

<p>As kept in mind, inappropriate temperature level and humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation may also add to worker health problems. Temperature level levels should vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air flow need to be avoided. Maintenance of appropriate temperature levels and humidity levels and appropriate air flow will assist to minimize the incident of upper breathing signs, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and hospitals, cars such as cars and trucks, trains, submarines, planes and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with respect to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may see musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>

At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes mild impacts that are typically incorrect for the flu. These signs include headaches, lightheadedness, queasiness, disorientation and tiredness. The effects of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from individual to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>

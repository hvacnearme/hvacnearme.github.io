<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

However, some producers require routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>

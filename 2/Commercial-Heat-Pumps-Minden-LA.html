Incorrectly located outdoor air consumption vents can likewise generate air infected with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological impurities that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

In damp or warm environments, preserving thermal convenience solely by means of natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as supplements or backups.

<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE.

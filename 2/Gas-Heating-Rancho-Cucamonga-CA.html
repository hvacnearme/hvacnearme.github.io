<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>

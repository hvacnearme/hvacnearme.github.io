<h3>Central Heating Repair in Franklin Park Illinois</h3>
<p>Although installation is simple and doesn't require much time, attempting this job is not an excellent idea. Unless you have training and knowledge of HVAC systems, taking on the installation might cause damage or installation mistakes that result in higher energy expenses and bad system performance. Additionally, HVAC systems have warranties that need certified service technicians to perform installation. You could void the service warranties by handling that job.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace must likewise be examined routinely. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire hazard. Detached fuel lines can jeopardize the performance of the HVAC system also. Soot can collect in burners and split heat exchanger s can have an influence on the system's efficiency as well. The maintenance. technicians will assess all of these elements of the furnace and carefully and eliminate all clogs and traces of soot.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has actually been utilized frequently in a range of structure construction products for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have prohibited numerous asbestos products. Manufacturers have likewise willingly limited usages of asbestos.

<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system.

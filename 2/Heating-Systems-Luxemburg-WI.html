I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

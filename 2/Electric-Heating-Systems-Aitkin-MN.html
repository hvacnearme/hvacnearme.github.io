<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>

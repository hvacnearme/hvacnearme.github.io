We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reduces exposure to pollutants during cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you buy a brand-new gas range or variety, consider buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continually. Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your home. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>

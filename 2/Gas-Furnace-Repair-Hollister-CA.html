<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>

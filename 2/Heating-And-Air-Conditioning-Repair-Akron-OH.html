<p>UW visitors, trainees and employees need to have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out numerous activities. If the air quality is poor it can affect a person's health, convenience, and efficiency.  The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to offer and maintain comfortable and healthy environments devoid of impurities. A crucial part of the program is reacting to and dealing with issues of structure occupants about issues in their workplace.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>

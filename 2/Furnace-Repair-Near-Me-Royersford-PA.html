<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other kinds of heat pumps, have actually performances ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a clinical way of identifying just how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. Many geothermal heat pump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0. This indicates for every system of energy used to power the system, three to five systems are provided as heat.<p>

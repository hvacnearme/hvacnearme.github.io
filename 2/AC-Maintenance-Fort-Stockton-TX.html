<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>

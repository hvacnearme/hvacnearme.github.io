<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each room in your house, and if it establishes cracks which leakage, they need to be fixed. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with worse outcomes. Your house will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy expenses will increase. Setting up brand-new ductwork for the whole house will cost an average of between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as essential when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>

And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>

Their techs are really knowledgeable and professional. Expenses are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get rival's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff due to the fact that the cost was undoubtedly affordable.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

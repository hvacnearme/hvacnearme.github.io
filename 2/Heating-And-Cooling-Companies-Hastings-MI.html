<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of 30 days throughout which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees.

<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window.

<p>There is no easy answer, however numerous use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better solution. If the present system has actually not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be identified and corrected, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

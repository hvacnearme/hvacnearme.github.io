<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires managed by experts, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>

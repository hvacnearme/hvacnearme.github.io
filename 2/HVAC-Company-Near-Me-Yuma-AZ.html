<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure products, smoking, home products, and using unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in made items. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a part of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coating items.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations build up inside your home.<p>

<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and harden-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>

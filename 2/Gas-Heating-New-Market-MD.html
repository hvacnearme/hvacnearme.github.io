<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

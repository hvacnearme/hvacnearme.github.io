It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results via a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to analyze.<p>

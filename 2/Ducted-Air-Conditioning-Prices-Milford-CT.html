Depending upon the kind of unit set up, it can be loud and trigger problems if you're highly adverse dust. In addition, specific fuels and equipment may require special licenses, and there is limited versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may see moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>

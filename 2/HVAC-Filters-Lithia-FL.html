<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors.

High humidities trigger mold development and wetness indoors is associated with a higher prevalence of resident respiratory problems.<p>

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

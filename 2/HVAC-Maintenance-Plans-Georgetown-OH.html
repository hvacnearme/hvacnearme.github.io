<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Compounding the noted health signs might be job stress. In part, due to numerous elements of office automation, the most demanding aspects of office work are increasing.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, the majority of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>

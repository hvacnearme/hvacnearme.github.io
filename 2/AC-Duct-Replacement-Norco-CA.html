The average summer temperature to arrive at the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the proper SEER ranking for your location, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>Through normal use and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit may end up being extremely filthy. These elements of the equipment are essential for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans all parts, and inspects connections to ensure they are protected. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for proper function and overall condition. This is an outstanding opportunity to determine parts that are used or malfunctioning. Replacing them to fix the air conditioning might be a lot less expensive when the issue is fairly minor.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might observe unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>

And mortar producers might decline guarantee coverage if you do not follow their instructions.<p>

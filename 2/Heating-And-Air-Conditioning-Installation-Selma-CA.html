<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>A specific a/c that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air course. A basic a/c transfers heat out of the room because its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>

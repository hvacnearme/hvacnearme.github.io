<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will often develop in ductwork, limiting airflow. Considering that ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear very daunting initially, needing specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Sparta GA</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I must state it gets the job done quite well. It takes extremely little time to heat up or cool off your home which is one of the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

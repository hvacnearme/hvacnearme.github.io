<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed.

For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors.

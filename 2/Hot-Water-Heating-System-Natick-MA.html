A trained technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>

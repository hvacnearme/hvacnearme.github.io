<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Red Hook NY Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from items or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>

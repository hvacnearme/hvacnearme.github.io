<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may see musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>

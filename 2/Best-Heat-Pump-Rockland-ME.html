Direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations construct up inside.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>

It wasn't until later, as they continued dealing with us, that they found out about and carried out indoor air quality keeping an eye on to provide a healthier, safer building environment-- and to head off the negative effects associated with indoor air contaminants.<p>
